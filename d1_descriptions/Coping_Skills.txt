Coping with pain is an important element in pain perception and responses. The Coping theory by Lazarus and Folkman has become widely applied in behavioral medicine (20). Coping is the behavioral response to pain aimed at generating and maintaining psychological well-being despite living with a serious condition. Coping styles can be emotion-oriented coping (such as catastrophizing and avoidance; ignoring and distress endurance) or active-approach coping (such as reinterpreting; diversion; acceptance and mindful interoception). The behavioral active efforts refer to measures taken to reduce pain, and the cognitive ones are aimed at reinterpreting pain or distraction. The avoidance of activity element in the fear-avoidance model can be viewed as a maladaptive coping style and catastrophizing as an emotion-oriented coping style.

Three studies described research on coping skills that include coping strategies (2 RPF with little SOE confidence), catastrophizing (one RPF with little SOE confidence), and self-efficacy (2 RPF with little to some SOE confidence) in relationship to disability, functional limitation, lifting capacity, work status, and transition from acute to chronic LBP. Similar to pain beliefs, authors discuss how fear-avoidance and reduced activity can lead to worsening physical conditioning.
