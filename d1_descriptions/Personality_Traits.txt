Personality influences how people constitute the meanings and implications of pain, and the adoption of different types of pain-related beliefs and coping strategies.  Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns influence pain perception. Personality traits represent a pattern of thinking that can influence processing and interpretation of oneâ€™s pain experience. Features linked to chronic pain sufferers include higher harm avoidance (e.g., being fearful, pessimistic, sensitive to criticism, requiring high levels of reassurance), and lower self-directedness (manifested by difficulty in defining and setting meaningful goals, low motivation, and problems with adaptive coping). Trait neuroticism is known to increase vulnerability to develop depression, anxiety, kinesiophobia and pain catastrophizing. Extroversion has been associated with more pain complaints. Trait anxiety is a personality characteristic of constant high arousal with a sense of tension, worry or apprehension relative to something adverse that might happen in the future. Positive traits include optimism, agreeableness, openness, emotional flexibility, and conscientiousness that help with social support network and acceptance of the situation, and add to coping resources (see below Psychological Resources).
