Pain beliefs and associated behaviors have been associated with cLBP activity interference, frequency of pain behavior, pain severity, and depression severity. The most notable beliefs are fear of movement and catastrophizing (maladaptive cognition). The patientsâ€™ capability to function (physically, psychologically, and socially) is influenced by their perceived self-efficacy or the belief that they can perform, their ability to endure and/or reduce pain, their confidence that the pain will improve, and their coping skills.

Nine studies reported on expectations (one RPF with little SOE confidence), fear avoidance (10 RPF with little to some SOE confidence), and pain-related anxiety (one RPF with substantial SOE confidence) assessed by questionnaire in relationship to pain severity, disability, lifting capacity, or transition from acute to chronic pain. Authors discussed how negative beliefs about pain can lead to catastrophizing and fear avoidance, which can result in further distress and reinforcement of a deleterious cycle.
