Coping style is dependent on an individualâ€™s psychological resources and can be limited by numerous potentially modifiable traits. These have been operationalized as distinct but often overlapping psychological constructs associated with resilience or vulnerability to pain. These have shown strong influences on the bothersomeness of pain, such as pain self-efficacy, resilience, the capacity to self-regulate, to regulate emotions, psychological flexibility, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness.
One study reported data regarding measures of negative psychological states (2 RPF with little SOE confidence) in relation to work status, pain, and functional limitations.
