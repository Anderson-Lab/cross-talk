Affect has components of valence (positive vs negative) and arousal (perceived intensity). Negative affect may constitute a long-term, trait-like vulnerability and has been found to be a risk factor for greater pain severity and is associated with emotions such as anger, sadness, irritability, state anxiety, and fear. In contrast, positive affective states (e.g., joy, hope, love, enthusiasm) are associated with better pain outcomes in longitudinal and experimental studies. Affect balance style is a measure of the relative levels of positive and negative trait affect within an individual. Having a depressive style (low positive affect relative to negative affect) has been associated with greater pain severity, and/or perception of pain without any relation to nociception or bodily symptoms (somatization). Personality trait components can influence certain affective states that can, in turn, influence reported pain sensitivity. 

Three studies summarized data regarding measures of affective state. These studies drew 8 depression-related conclusions (with little to some SOE confidence) in relationship to work status, opioid use, disability, lifting capacity, pain severity, and overall health status. The authors discuss how depression is a common comorbidity of cLBP conditions and contributes via mechanisms included in the biopsychosocial and fear-avoidance models.
