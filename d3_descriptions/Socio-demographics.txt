Several social factors/determinants influence cLBP experience, such as socioeconomic status (SES) as a function of education, income and occupation, access to care, race, and gender. We define race as a social construct levied upon individuals/groups by society, and gender as how a person aligns with socially constructed roles, behaviors, and expressions. A patientâ€™s experience of health and illness is framed by not only their social and cultural context, but also the social, cultural and historical context of those delivering care. Pain is perceived and experienced differently according to ethno-culture with its health beliefs and expectations. Characteristics of the social environment include social support and invalidating, stigmatizing or discriminating responses from others. Coping strategies could be religious or spiritual practices, like meditation and prayer, that are incorporated as a cognitive process of self-management. These may vary across cultures. The effect of socio-economic factors is (only) partly mediated by stress (perceived: self-report; objective: HPA-axis and ANS measures) and coping styles with stressors.

One study reported data related to emotional and social support systems (two RPF with little SOE confidence) in relation to work status, pain, and functional limitation.
