{"title": "Spinal Column", "text": "The spinal column is biomechanically stabilized by three subsystems: 1) passive subsystem that includes bone, cartilage, ligaments, intervertebral disc; 2) active subsystem that includes the paraspinal muscles; and 3) the neural control subsystem. the para are often conceptualized separately, but proprioception , which refers to afferent information arising from internal peripheral areas that contribute to postural control , joint stability , and several conscious sensations are functionally interdependent. Motor control and function include muscle recruitment, strength, and endurance. An important feedback component of neuromotor control is proprioception, which refers to afferent information arising from internal peripheral areas that contribute to postural control, joint stability, and several conscious sensations. Movement and control disorders presumably lead to a proprioceptive deficit, because of stress on local muscle spindles and joint receptors in the painful area resulting from stress to a joint caused by an individual\u2019s maladaptive movement. Subsequently, abnormal joint and tissue loading during daily activities and postures may affect local proprioceptors and maintain this vicious cycle. Changes in muscle activity have been linked to spinal pain (muscle-tension or pain-spasm-pain model) or restriction of spinal motion (pain adaptation)."}
