0,"The spinal column is biomechanically stabilized by three subsystems: 1) passive subsystem that includes bone, cartilage, ligaments, intervertebral disc; 2) active subsystem that includes the paraspinal muscles; and 3) the neural control subsystem. These subsystems are often conceptualized separately, but they are functionally interdependent. Motor control and function include muscle recruitment, strength, and endurance. An important feedback component of neuromotor control is proprioception, which refers to afferent information arising from internal peripheral areas that contribute to postural control, joint stability, and several conscious sensations. Movement and control disorders presumably lead to a proprioceptive deficit, because of stress on local muscle spindles and joint receptors in the painful area resulting from stress to a joint caused by an individual’s maladaptive movement. Subsequently, abnormal joint and tissue loading during daily activities and postures may affect local proprioceptors and maintain this vicious cycle. Changes in muscle activity have been linked to spinal pain (muscle-tension or pain-spasm-pain model) or restriction of spinal motion (pain adaptation).","The spinal column is biomechanically stabilized by three subsystems: 1) passive subsystem that includes bone, cartilage, ligaments, intervertebral disc; 2) active subsystem that includes the paraspinal muscles; and 3) the neural control subsystem.

1,"The personal history of a patient spans many facets of life including employment status and occupation, marital and insurance status. It also includes social history such as alcohol, tobacco and substance use in addition to personal preferences, expectations, habits such as sleep schedule, clothing choices, and diet. The patient's medical history of isolated and chronic illnesses is important as well. All of these entities likely contribute to how pain is experienced in each individual.","The personal history of a patient spans many facets of life including employment status and occupation, marital and insurance status.
