{"title": "Personal/Medical History", "text": "Sensory disturbances such as pain sensitivity are frequent features of chronic pain. Increased pain sensitivity in the primary pain area is considered a sign of peripheral sensitization, whereas pain sensitivity in areas anatomically remote from the central or peripheral nervous systems cortical reorganization , neuronal sensitization reflects a more central phenomenon.  People with heightened pain sensitivity report higher levels of pain/disability due to dysregulation of the central or peripheral nervous systems: cortical reorganization, neuronal sensitization/hyperexcitability. These are characterized by generalized hypersensitivity to both noxious and non-noxious stimuli (e.g., hyperalgesia, allodynia). fMRI studies demonstrate evidence of central pain amplification, altered nociceptive processing (nociplastic pain state) where a clear peripheral tissue injury may be completely absent. Quantitative measures of grey matter volume by MRI in cLBP patients demonstrate decreases in regions predominantly related to pain perception and integration. The assessment of sensory function using quantitative sensory testing (QST) can provide evidence of pain hypersensitivity."}
