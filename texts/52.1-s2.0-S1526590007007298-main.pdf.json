with CLBP.\nThis study examined the psychometric properties of a short electronic version of the PHODA (PHODA-SeV).\nThe results show that the PHODA-SeV measures a single factor and has a high internal consistency.\nThe test-retest reliability and stability of the PHODA-SeV over a 2-week time interval are good, with discrepancies between 2 measurements over 20 points suggesting true change.\nThe construct validity is supported by the finding that both self-reported pain severity and fear of movement/(re)injury were uniquely related to the PHODA-SeV.\nThe findings support the PHODA-SeV as a valid and reliable measure of the perceived harmfulness of activities in patients with CLBP.\nPreliminary normative data of the PHODA-SeV are presented.\nPerspective: This article describes a pictorial measurement tool (PHODA-SeV) for the assessment of the perceived harmfulness of activities in patients with chronic low back pain.\nThe PHODA-SeV has good psychometric properties and can be used to elaborate on the contribution of beliefs about harmful consequences of activities to pain and disability.\nany people will experience acute low back pain (LBP) during their lifetime, of whom fortunately only few will develop chronic low back pain (CLBP).\n7,24,34,43 Not only is pain-related fear associated with disability during the chronic stage,1,16,18,24 but the treatments that aim to reduce pain-related fear in these patients have also been found to be effective.\nPain-related fear is a general, overarching construct, encompassing various specific fears.\nAddress reprint requests to Dr.\nThe PHODA is an instrument that includes photographs of various daily activities.\nBack pain patients have to indicate to what extent they perceive these daily activities to be harmful to the back.\nHence, the PHODA is a straightforward tool that specifically focuses on a patients judgements about the harmful consequences of certain movements.\nIn addition to being used to guide treatment decisions, the PHODA has been used as a measurement instrument in several studies that examined the effectiveness of exposure in vivo in CLBP.\n6,11,12,28,48,50-53 Despite these previous applications, the psychometric properties of the PHODA have never been studied.\nThis study aims to develop and then report on the psychometric properties of a shortened electronic version derived from the original PHODA (PHODA-SeV; both versions of the PHODA can be ordered by e-mail: PHODA@HSZuyd.\nThe institutional ethics committee approved the research protocol, and all participants provided informed consent.\nDifferent subgroups of this study sample were included for the various analyses of this study.\nIn total, 113 patients with CLBP, who were referred by physicians from various rehabilitation facilities in the Netherlands, completed the PHODA-SeV as part of the initial screening procedure for participation in the RCT.\nExclusion criteria were: (1) to have too little disability (Roland Disability Questionnaire 4), (2) to be illiterate, (3) to be pregnant, (4) to report substance abuse, (5) to be involved in any litigation concerning disability income, (6) to have specific medical disorders or cardiovascular diseases preventing participation in physical exercise, and (7) to present with serious psychopathology (as determined with Dutch norms of the SCL-90).\nThe included participants then completed 2 measurements before start of treatment with a test-retest interval of 2 weeks, during which they also completed the PHODA-SeV.\nBecause PHODA-SeV data of the second pretreatment measurement were lost for 1 participant due to computer failure, 84 participants with both pretreatment measurements remained.\nThe included patients (N  85) were randomized, with prestratification on the basis of the degree of pain catastrophizing and disability, either to exposure in vivo (N  42) or to graded activity (N  43).\nThe PHODA-SeV was again administered at the end of treatment.\nThe original PHODA23 was developed out of a need for a diagnostic tool to determine the perceived harmfulness of different physical activities and movements.\nThe point of departure in this development consisted of 8 possible movements (lifting, bending, turning, reaching, falling, intermittent load, unexpected movement, and long-lasting load in stance or sit with limited dynamics), which were derived from basic movements (extending, inflecting, rotating, lateral inflecting, compression, and traction) and 2 manners of moving (static and dynamic).\nThese 8 possible movements were then set against 4 areas of daily occupations (activities of daily living, housekeeping, work, and sport and leisure time) and converted into recognizable and frequent activities instead of in terms of their biomechanics.\nThe resulting list of movements and activities was tested, corrected, and supplemented by several experts on CLBP (human movement scientists, physical therapists, and psychologists).\nFinally, this resulted in 100 photographs of daily activities.\nFor every basic movement category, activities were selected with variable degrees of rated harmfulness (unpublished data).\nA visual presentation of the PHODA-SeV is depicted in Fig 1.\nThe patient, who sits in front of a computer monitor, is exposed to the photographs, and is requested to drag each photograph along a harmfulness thermometer ranging from 0 (not harmful al all) to 100 (extremely harmful).\nThe following verbal instruction is given before the start of the test: Please observe each photograph carefully, and try to imagine yourself performing the same movement.\nEach photograph is given a rating according to its position on the thermometer.\nDue to the electronic administration, this assessment tool is highly standardized and the data are automatically stored into an electronic database.\nThe basic properties of the original PHODA (such as the instruction, the possibility for the patient to move the pictures along the harmfulness thermometer at any time, the fact that all pictures remain visible along the fear thermometer) are maintained, except for the interaction with the therapist.\nThe time to complete the PHODA-SeV is approximately 10 minutes.\nThe Dutch version56 of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)30 was administered as a self-report measure of fear of movement/(re)injury.\nThe TSK consists of 17 statements that can be rated on a 4-point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.\nThe total score is calculated after inversion of items 4, 8, 12, and 16, which are phrased in reversed key.\nThe photographs of the PHODA-SeV are presented in small format in a row.\nThe patient can select each photograph by clicking on it.\nThe small photograph that is selected by the patient emerges in large format.\nThe selected photograph also appears in small format at this position, from which it can be dragged with the mouse to the corresponding value on the thermometer.\nBy this means, all photographs remain visible along the thermometer.\nThe patient can reposition each photograph at any time, by selecting it with the mouse and dragging it somewhere else.\nSeveral studies demonstrated the TSK to have an invariant two-factor structure among various pain diagnoses.\nUnpublished authorized Dutch/Flemish translation, 1996, of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS]41) was used to determine the degree of catastrophizing about the pain experience.\nPain catastrophizing is defined as an exaggerated negative orientation towards actual or anticipated pain experiences.\nThe PCS consists of 13 items, on which the patients are asked to indicate on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (always), to which degree they experience certain thoughts or feelings during pain.\nThe total score ranges between 0 and 52.\nThe PCS has been shown to consist of 3, highly internally consistent, subscales31,41,46, and to have a good test-retest reliability.\nValidity of the PCS was supported by the finding that people who score high on catastrophizing report more negative pain-related thoughts, more emotional distress, and more pain when undergoing a painful procedure than those low on catastrophizing.\n41 Moreover, the PCS shows a positive association with another measure of catastrophizing.\nThe Dutch version of the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ)3,17,39 was used to determine the level of functional disability.\nThe RDQ aims to measure the severity of perceived disability by questioning about limitations concerning 24 activities of daily living that can be answered by either yes or no.\nThe RDQ has a high testretest reliability39 and is responsive to change.\nParticipants were asked to indicate their current pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analogue scale ranging from no pain at all to unbearable pain, which was part of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ).\nWe performed an exploratory factor analysis with Oblimin Rotation.\nThe number of factors embedded in the PHODA-SeV was determined by using the scree test and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin criterion.\nTo test the reliability of the PHODA-SeV over time, the inclusion group (N  84) was used.\nThe test-retest reliability was determined by calculating a Pearson correlation over the 2 pretreatment measurements.\nWe furthermore plotted the difference between the 2 measurements against their mean, as suggested by Bland and Altman.\nThe construct validity of the PHODA-SeV was investigated in 2 ways.\nFor these analyses, we used the inclusion group (N  84).\nThe second method we used to determine the construct validity of the PHODA-SeV was to investigate whether patients who received exposure in vivo treatment demonstrated lower post-treatment PHODA-SeV scores than those who received graded activity.\nExposure in vivo treatment is designed specifically to address and diminish the perceived harmfulness of activities, as opposed to graded activity, which is designed to address the reinforcing consequences of pain behavior.\nTherefore differential decreases in perceived harmfulness of activities are to be expected between these groups (for a detailed description of rationales and mechanisms of exposure treatment and graded activity see Vlaeyen et al and Sanders, respectively).\nComplete case analyses were used, including patients who either completed or prematurely terminated treatment and who performed the post-treatment measurement.\nThe exposure in vivo group (N  40) as well as the graded activity group (N  35) were therefore included in these analyses.\nThe second baseline measurement of the PHODA-SeV was used as pretreatment measure.\nWhen dropouts did not differ from completers on any of these variables, we performed subsequent analyses.\nWe performed an ANCOVA with post-treatment PHODA-SeV score as the dependent variable, group as between subject variable, and pretreatment score included as the covariate, as this method has more power than ANOVA of the post-test or ANOVA of change.\nTo establish norms for the PHODA-SeV, data of the screening group (N  113) were included in the analyses.\nFirst, we tested dependence of the PHODA-SeV score on various background variables, by means of a multiple linear regression analysis with the PHODA-SeV as the dependent variable, and age, gender, duration of complaints, and educational level as independent variables.\nIf none of these variables was related to the PHODA-SeV score, norms were based on the score distribution in the total screening group.\nIf dependence of the PHODA-SeV score on some background variable was found, this was taken into account by adjusting the score for the relevant background variable.\nA normality check was performed to test whether the PHODA-SeV scores were normally distributed.\nIn case of a normal distribution, it is sufficient to present the mean score and standard deviation of the group, to which individual scores can be compared by computing the corresponding z score.\nIn case of a non-normal distribution, deciles of the PHODA-SeV score distribution need to be presented.\nData about education, work status, and complaints were unavailable for 9 participants of the screening group.\nA normality check for each of the 40 PHODA-SeV items showed no substantive deviations (apart from positive skewness for photograph 94 which had the lowest mean).\nThe mean duration between both measurements was 14.\nThe categories of work status were not mutually exclusive, due to which more than one category could apply for 1 participant.\nthe numbers above show, the standard deviation was also very similar at both measurements.\nThe 95% confidence interval for the lower bound of the limits of agreement was 19.\nThe number of the photograph refers to that of the original PHODA.\nThe PHODA-SeV appeared to be significantly related to the TSK, PCS, RDQ, and MPQ current pain intensity.\nTo disentangle which of these constructs is uniquely related to the measure of perceived harmfulness of activities while correcting for shared variance, a multiple linear regression was performed (Table 4).\nThese results indicate that the perceived harmfulness of physical activities is associated with the level of fear of movement/ (re)injury as well as the current level of pain severity.\nSecond, we investigated the construct validity of the PHODA-SeV by comparing post-treatment PHODA-SeV scores of those who received graded activity treatment with those who received exposure in vivo.\nSince 26 of 85 patients dropped out during treatment, 10 of whom refused to complete post-treatment measurement, we first tested whether the dropouts were comparable to those who completed treatment.\nUnivariate comparisons revealed that dropouts did not differ between groups (2  .\nAs expected given the randomized treatment assignment, the 2 treatment groups were similar on the pretest PHODA-SeV score (mean of 55.\nPosttreatment PHODA-SeV scores were 42.\nThus, there was a large difference between both groups in post-treatment PHODA-SeV scores, with those who received exposure in vivo demonstrating lower scores than those who received graded activity.\nFurthermore, it was found that in the exposure in vivo condition 25 out of 40 patients (63%) demonstrated a pretest to post-test change in PHODA-SeV score beyond the limits of agreement, whereas this was only the case for 12 out of 35 patients (34%) in the graded activity condition.\nNote, however, that the pre-post time interval was larger than the 2 weeks interval from which the limits of agreement were obtained.\nIt was therefore reasonable to calculate the PHODA-SeV descriptives for the total group, rather than to determine norms with multiple regression on demographic and other relevant patient variables.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of a short electronic version of the PHODA as a measure of the perceived harmfulness of daily activities in patients with CLBP.\nAdvantages of this PHODASeV over the original PHODA are its standardized administration, the fact that it is less time-consuming, and its automatic data storage.\nThe PHODA-SeV measures a single factor and has a high internal consistency.\nThe testretest reliability of the PHODA-SeV over a 2-week timeinterval is excellent.\nThe PHODA-SeV score is computed by dividing the sum of all 40 items of the PHODA-SeV by 40 and thus ranges from 0 to 100, just as each item does.\nHowever, it is important to recognize the rather short time interval (2 weeks) over which the stability was determined.\nOver longer time intervals, the natural variation may be expected to be larger.\nThe construct validity of the PHODA-SeV is supported by consistent relationships with related constructs, such as self-report measures of fear of movement/(re)injury, pain catastrophizing, functional disability, and current pain intensity.\nMore specifically, after correction for the common variance between these constructs, it appeared that the PHODA-SeV is specifically related to the degree of fear of movement/(re)injury as well as to pain intensity.\nFurthermore, this indicates that people experiencing more pain may be more worried that certain activities may aggravate their already painful, and potentially damaged, back than people experiencing less pain.\nConstruct validity was further corroborated by the finding that patients in the exposure in vivo treatment condition, aimed at systematically reducing the perceived harmfulness of physical activities, had much lower post-treatment PHODA-SeV scores than the patients in the graded activity condition, during which the perceived harmfulness of physical activities was not challenged.\nThere are some limitations that need to be considered in interpreting these results.\nFirst, for the factor analyses the observation to record ratio (N  113 with 40 observations per participant) may have been suboptimal.\nAlso, since too small a group would complicate the factor pattern, the straightforward pattern that was found supports a single factor structure.\nFurthermore, simple factor structures with high loadings, as is the case with the PHODASeV, require smaller sample size for sufficient power than complex structures with moderate loadings.\nTo confirm the single factor structure of the PHODA-SeV, it will need to be cross validated among other samples of (CLBP) pain patients.\nThe third limitation is that this study only used self-report measures, which may be influenced by self-presentational strategies.\nIt would be worthwhile to test the construct validity of the PHODA-SeV by relating it to behavioural task performance.\nDespite these limitations, it may be concluded that the reliability and validity of the PHODA-SeV are good to excellent.\nThe decile scores (Table 5) of the PHODASeV can provide researchers and clinicians with a frame of reference for the ratings of other patients with CLBP in rehabilitation and pain clinic settings.\nAlthough this is the first study providing such a frame of reference for PHODA-SeV scores, these data should be considered as preliminary, since the sample size on which the data are based is small.\nFurther research is needed to establish normative data of the PHODA-SeV based on larger sample sizes.\nAnother note of importance in interpreting these normative data is that these are based on a population with quite severe complaints.\nThe participants suffered from CLBP for more than 10 years on average (Table 1), were referred for rehabilitation care, and more than half were on sick leave or received disability pension.\nYet, since the distribution of PHODA-SeV scores showed a large variation that covered almost the entire possible scale range, and since the duration of complaints did not influence the total score, it is possible that these normative score may also apply to chronic pain populations with less severe complaints.\nThis study used a short electronic version of the PHODA, and it can therefore be questioned whether these results can be generalized to the original PHODA.\nMoreover, due to the good to excellent properties of the PHODA-SeV, it can be suggested that this shortened edition may actually be more useful than the complete version.\nIn this study, the PHODA-SeV was administered as a measurement tool.\nIt is thus unknown whether the results of this study generalize to the PHODA-SeV used for clinical purposes, during which ample interaction between the clinician and patient is possible.\nHowever, since the instruction and other basic properties of the PHODA were maintained during administration of the PHODA-SeV, there is no obvious reason to expect different results in applications as clinical diagnostic instrument.\nWe would like to express our gratitude to Rosanne Jansen for programming the PHODA-SeV and to Jeroen de Jong for selecting the items of the PHODA-SeV.\nFurthermore, we are grateful to Sita van Riet and Magda van Duinen for their assistance in the data collection, and to the therapists delivering the cognitive-behavioral treatments.\nWe are also thankful to the 2 anonymous reviewers for providing valuable suggestions for improvement to the manuscript.\nAl-Obaidi SM, Al-Zoabi B, Al-Shuwaie N, Al-Zaabie N, Nelson RM: The influence of
