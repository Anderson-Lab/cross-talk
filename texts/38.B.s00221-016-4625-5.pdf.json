skin of the low back with an  EMLA anesthetic can effectively decrease the cutaneous  sensitivity of low back region.\nFurther, these decreases in  peripheral cutaneous sensitivity are similar in magnitude  to those reported in CLBP patients.\nWithin this healthy  population, decreased cutaneous sensitivity of the low back  region has minimal influence on active lumbar spine proprioception, neuromuscular control and dynamic stability.\nTo complete dynamic motor tasks and ensure adequate  stability of the lumbar spine, sensitivity of the proprioceptive and kinesthetic systems is necessary.\nSensory  feedback systems, which facilitate coordinated and stable  movement patterns, include inputs from visual, vestibular,  cutaneous, ligamentous and muscular subsystems (Proske  and Gandevia 2012).\nAbstract The purpose of the current work was to (1)  determine whether low back cutaneous sensitivity could  be reduced through the use of a topical lidocaineprilocaine anesthetic (EMLA) to mirror reductions reported  in chronic lower back pain (CLBP) patients, as well as to  (2) identify whether reductions in cutaneous sensitivity  resulted in decreased lumbar spine proprioception, neuromuscular control and dynamic stability.\nTwenty-eight  healthy participants were divided equally into matched  EMLA and PLACEBO treatment groups.\nGroups completed cutaneous minimum monofilament and two-point  discrimination (TPD) threshold tests, as well as tests of  sagittal and axial lumbar spine active repositioning error,  seated balance and repeated lifting dynamic stability.\nThese  tests were administered both before and after the application of an EMLA or PLACEBO treatment.\nResults show  that low back minimum monofilament and TPD thresholds  were significantly increased within the EMLA group.\nSkin  sensitivity remained unchanged in the PLACEBO group.\nIn the EMLA group, decreases in low back cutaneous sensitivity had minimal effect on low back proprioception  (active sagittal and axial repositioning) and dynamic stability (seated balance and repeated lifting).\nIn addition to these receptors, the  skin of the torso also includes receptors located within hair  follicles, which are especially sensitive to hair movement  (Gardner and Johnson 2013).\nFurthermore, it has been suggested that the deficits in tactile  acuity are related to the guarded/encumbered lumbopelvic  motor movements associated with CLBP (Luomajoki and  Moseley 2011).\nHow the feedback from these cutaneous  sensory receptors located within the low back contributes  to the control of lumbar spine movement and proprioception is still unknown.\nPrevious works have demonstrated that CLBP patients  have diminished tactile sensitivity atop the skin of the  low back, paired with encumbered motor strategies of the  lumbopelvic region (Luomajoki and Moseley 2011; Moseley 2008; Catley et al.\nBased on these findings, recent research has begun  to suggest that sensory retraining paradigms that target  tactile sensitivity of a painful region can assist in reducing  perceptions of pain as well as improving the motor control  of the lumbar spine.\nIt  is currently unknown, however, whether the tactile acuity  deficits observed in CLBP (as well as the effects of tactile  sensory retraining) act through peripheral (e.\nAs a means to modulate cutaneous sensory feedback,  previous works have employed the use of an anesthetic to  decrease/eliminate cutaneous sensitivity from a particular  anatomical area (Bjrkman et al.\nWith this idealized  removal of skin information, researchers are able to speculate on how the eliminated cutaneous mechanosensitive  feedback contributes to the control of posture, dynamic  movement or proprioception.\nBased on this, the primary goals of the present  study were to (1) discern whether decreases in lumbar tactile acuity (as a result of the EMLA treatment) in healthy  participants could mirror those reported in CLBP patients,  as well as to (2) identify whether these peripheral tactile  insensitivities alone would result in larger movement variability, decreased stability and decreased proprioception of  the lumbar spine.\nFourteen male and fourteen female participants were  divided evenly into age, height and weight-matched treatment and PLACEBO groups (Table 1).\nParticipant exclusion criteria included the presence of pain within the  lumbopelvic or lower-limb region as well as any diagnosed sensory or motor deficit disorders.\nAll participants  (n = 28) completed a health screening questionnaire and  signed informed consent prior to data collection.\nThe study  was approved by the institutional research ethics board in  accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nAll collections were completed at the same time of day,  each with a total duration of approximately 4.\nThe first half an hour  was allotted for instruction and practice of the experimental tasks as well as for the consent process.\nThe order  of proprioceptive and stability tasks were randomized and  balanced between participants and were held in a constant  order during repeated assessments within each participant.\nThe boundaries for cream application were defined anatomically based on the superiorinferior (SI) locations of  the T12 and S1 spinous processes as well as the mediallateral (ML) peripheral boundaries of the left and right paraspinal muscle bellies (Fig.\nThe average dose area for  each participant group is presented in Table 1.\nDuring the  administration of the EMLA or PLACEBO treatment, all  participants, and experimenters taking any measurements,  were blinded to the type of skin treatment cream.\nCutaneous sensitivity was measured across three separate  assessments relative to the application of either the EMLA  or PLACEBO treatment cream.\nThese assessments included  measures prior to cream application (PRE-SENS), immediately following cream removal (POST-SENS1) as well as  immediately following the completion of the second round .\nThe POST-SENS1 and POST-SENS2 assessments  were separated in time by ~4045 min.\nControl test locations (outside of dose area) were assessed at the T9 level  both immediately superior to the vertebral spinous process  (T9SP) and superior to the right-side paraspinal muscle  belly (T9MB).\nExperimental test locations (within dose  area) were assessed at the L1 and L4 vertebral levels, again  both superior to the vertebral spinous process (e.\nPrior to any cutaneous  sensitivity tests, each test location was lightly shaved with  a disposable razor, with care not to abrade the skin.\nMMTS tests were completed at  six anatomical test locations including T9SP, T9MB, L1SP,  L1MB, L4SP and L4MB.\nTPD tests were completed in a  superiorinferior orientation at two anatomical test locations, T9MB and L4MB.\nProprioceptive acuity was tested across two separate  assessments relative to the application of either the EMLA  or PLACEBO treatment cream.\nThe first tests were completed prior to cream application, immediately following  the cutaneous sensitivity assessments (PRE), while the  second tests were completed following cream removal,  again immediately following the cutaneous sensitivity  tests (POST).\nSagittal repositioning was performed while seated  in a kneeling chair, while axial repositioning was performed while seated upright on a twisting platform.\nFor  each task, participants were required to (without the use  of vision, at a self-selected pace) either flex or rightward  twist, away from their starting neutral position, toward  a random target within ~10 of each participants neutral  range of motion (ROM).\nAfter holding this target for ~2 s,  participants were required to flex/twist to their end ROM  and hold this position again for ~2 s.\nSagittal repositioning kinematic data were acquired from rigid bodies consisting of  three non-collinear kinematic markers affixed at the T12  and S1 vertebral levels.\nBoth sets of kinematic data were sampled at 100 Hz  (Optotrak 3D Investigator, Northern Digital, Waterloo, ON,  Canada).\nSimilar to the proprioceptive acuity tests, each lumbar  spine stability test was completed at the same PRE and  POST assessments.\nParticipants  were instructed to remain as stable as possible with their  arms crossed against their chest and legs strapped together  at the knees and ankles to minimize potential compensatory leg movements.\nEach seated balance test was repeated  five times at both the PRE and POST assessments.\nRaw kinematic data from the repositioning and repeated  lifting tasks were filtered (4th order dual-pass Butterworth)  with a 6 Hz low-pass cutoff.\nTo quantify 3D lumbar spine  angles (for the sagittal plane repositioning task as well as  the repeated lifting task), a flexion/extension (FE), lateral  bend (LB), axial twist (AT) Cardan rotational sequence  was implemented.\nTo quantify 3D axial rotations during the  axial repositioning test, the twist platform rigid body orientation was quantified in 3D global space.\nTo assess sagittal or axial angular lumbar spine active repositioning error, three estimates were used: constant error  (CE), absolute error (AE) and variable error (VE) (e.\nTo estimate the LDS, the maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponent (LyE) was calculated for each seated balance and repeated lifting time series.\nThe time series data used to estimate LDS were Euclidean norm lumbar spine angles during the repeated lifting .\nTo best ensure steadystate repeated lifting dynamics, lifts 15 were excluded.\nFor repeated lifting, a time delay  (Td) of 10 % of a lifting cycle was used, paired with an  embedding dimension (dE) of 6, estimated using a global  false nearest neighbors (GFNN) analysis (Kennel et al.\nFor seated balance, a Td of 11  and 10 frames was used for the AP and ML CoP displacement data, respectively, paired with a dE of eight.\nAll of these analyses were performed using custom software developed in MATLAB (The MathWorks,  Natick MA, USA).\nFor each cutaneous  sensitivity test (MMTS and TPD), two separate (EMLA  and PLACEBO) two-way, repeated measures ANOVAs  were completed to evaluate the impact of PRE-SENS/ POST-SENS1/POST-SENS2 assessment and location on  each respective dependent variable.\nFor all other tests (axial  and sagittal repositioning, seated balance and repeated  lifting), two separate (EMLA and PLACEBO) one-way  repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to evaluate  the effect of each PRE/POST assessment on each respective dependent variable.\nFor all analyses, post hoc pairwise  multiple means comparisons were made using a Tukey  adjustment to determine the cause of any significant main  effects ( = 0.\nAll statistical analyses were performed  using SAS 9.\nPost hoc tests revealed that the  EMLA treatment induced significantly higher MMTS and  TPD thresholds, indicating reduced sensitivity, within the  test locations, especially at POST-SENS1.\nAll MMTS and TPD measurements at the control T9 level  (T9SP or T9MB) were unaffected by the EMLA treatment.\nFor the EMLA  group, axial repositioning estimates of VE were observed  to differ significantly between PRE and POST assessments  (F-ratio = 7.\nAll repositioning data are given in Table 2.\nSpecifically, post hoc  tests revealed that CoP AP velocity ranges and AP velocity RMS were larger during PRE when compared to POST.\nNote  that an increased threshold  indicates a decreased sensitivity.\nMonofilament data are  presented from the T9 spinous  process (T9SP) and muscle  belly (T9MB) control locations  as well as the experimental  L1 and L4 spinous process  (L1SP and L4SP) and muscle belly (L1MB and L4MB)  test locations.\nAll data are presented  as mean  SEM.\nFurther, similar trends were observed for CoP AP velocity range, ML  velocity range and ML velocity RMS.\nFor both the EMLA and PLACEBO participant groups, all repeated lifting dependent  variables (FE, LB and AT range and variability as well as  LyE) were unaffected by each PRE/POST assessment.\nNote that  an increased threshold indicated  a decreased sensitivity.\nTPD  data are presented from the  T9 muscle belly (T9MB)  control location as well as the  experimental L4 muscle belly  (L4MB) test location.\nAll data are presented  as mean  SEM.\nError estimates include constant errors (CE), absolute errors (AE) and variable errors (VE) for each of the EMLA and PLACEBO participant  groups.\nNote that a smaller LyE value represents an increase in stability.\nThe primary goals of the present study were to (1) determine whether topical anesthesia (EMLA) atop the skin of  the low back had the capacity to decrease cutaneous mechanosensitivity (mirroring cutaneous insensitivities observed  in CLBP patients) and (2) to assess whether this decrease  in cutaneous sensitivity of the low back influenced estimates of lumbar spine proprioception, dynamic movement  control and LDS in a group of healthy young adults.\nWe  were able to confirm a decrease in cutaneous sensitivity in  response to an EMLA treatment; however, we were unable  to detect any consistent declines in lumbar spine proprioception, dynamic movement control or LDS in response to  decreased skin sensitivity.\nIn accordance with our first hypothesis, the EMLA topical anesthetic decreased cutaneous sensitivity based on our  estimates of MMTS and TPD thresholds (Figs.\nInspecting our POST-SENS1 cutaneous assessments, the  current data show that EMLA induced an average increase  in MMTS threshold of 6462 %, paired with an average  increase in TPD threshold of 200 %, across all test locations (e.\nThis cutaneous insensitivity persisted until  our final POST-SENS2 cutaneous assessment for both  the MMTS (2038 % increase) and TPD (175 % increase)  threshold measures.\nFurther, it is also noteworthy that the decreased TPD sensitivity in our EMLA treatment group is in line with the  reported sensory deficit experienced in CLBP patients (e.\nIn partial accordance with our second hypothesis,  decreased cutaneous sensitivity of the skin of the low back  resulted in decreased axial repositioning precision (VE)  within our EMLA treatment group (Table 2).\nThis suggests that the cutaneous information from the skin of the  low back may be used, to some degree, to provide feedback for the precision of active movements of the lumbar  spine within the axial plane.\nTherefore, it is possible that feedback from  the skin of the low back serves a larger role within these  axial plane tasks, and further, removal of cutaneous sensory  feedback has some effect.\nHowever, overall, any potential  effects of the decreased cutaneous sensitivity were limited,  as no other variables assessed within the current paradigm  demonstrated a significant effect.\nFurther, the small effect  sizes (Cohens D) preversus post-EMLA application support the notion of a lack of a clinically significant impact.\nNote that a smaller LyE value represents an increase in stability.\n2015), it is possible that our anesthesia treatment was too focal and that other areas of skin (or other  sensory systems) were able to compensate for the decreased  low back cutaneous sensitivity.\n, during standing balance), the  contribution of cutaneous sensory feedback may have a  more profound effect in the maintenance of lumbar spine  proprioception or stability.\nFurther research to assess the  relative dependence of muscular and cutaneous sensory  feedback, across various static postures and dynamic tasks,  is needed to determine whether this is the case.\nContrary to our second hypothesis, it is clear that a  decreased sensitivity of the skin of the low back has no significant effect on estimates of active sagittal repositioning  error (Table 2), seated balance (Table 3) or repeated lifting  (Table 4).\nThrough previous research, active sagittal repositioning tests have been shown to be sensitive to vibrational  sensory perturbations in healthy participants (Brumagne  et al.\nTherefore, these tests of lumbar spine movement control have been shown previously  to be sensitive to various sensory perturbations and task  demands.\nThis reliance on muscle-mediated feedback  within sagittal plane movements has been noted during previous research using vibrational interventions designed to  target muscle spindle sensory channels (e.\nIn interpreting the results of this study, there are some  limitations to consider.\nHowever, the  current MMTS data demonstrate that even if the desensitization brought on by the EMLA anesthetic was reduced  at the POST-SENS2 assessment, its effects are still present  (2038 % increase in MMTS threshold at POST-SENS2  relative to PRE-SENS).\nSecond, due to the maximum dose  suggested by the EMLA manufacturers (400 cm2), it was  only possible to anesthetize a relatively small area of the  low back (Table 1).\n1 g/cm2 was  chosen to adhere to the maximum dose while also providing a sufficient depth of cream as to completely cover the  test area; however, it is possible that a dose over a larger, or  different, area may have resulted in greater influence on the  low back proprioception, dynamic movement and LDS variables.\nThird, it is apparent within our seated balance data  that both participants groups improved at the task between  our PRE and POST time points (Table 3).\nHowever, as  this was true for both our EMLA and PLACEBO groups,  it does not impact our ability to address the influence of  decreased cutaneous sensitivity on this task.\nFinally, all of  the analyzed proprioceptive and stability tasks were conducted under active muscular control.\nIt is possible that  if passive movements were explored (resulting in reduced  muscular sensory feedback), larger effects of cutaneous  desensitization would have been observed.\nHowever, we  were most interested in an ecologically relevant, real-world  scenario in which any potential use of cutaneous sensory  information would occur in addition to readily available  information from other remaining senses.\nIn conclusion, the current work demonstrates that over-thecounter, topical lidocaineprilocaine-based anesthetic (1)  can effectively decrease the cutaneous sensitivity of low  back region and (2) has a minimal effect on low back proprioceptive and movement capability during active tasks.\nThe decreases in low back cutaneous sensitivity observed  here mirror those reported in CLBP patients.\nwith recurrent CLBP, it appears that peripheral cutaneous insensitivities alone cannot explain declines in lumbar  spine motor control.\nIt is possible that higher level cortical changes drive any motor declines associated with tactile  insensitivity and that benefits from tactile sensory retraining modalities necessitate more than simple changes in  peripheral sensitivity alone.\nConflict of interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts  of interest.\nAimonetti JM, Roll JP, Hospod V,
