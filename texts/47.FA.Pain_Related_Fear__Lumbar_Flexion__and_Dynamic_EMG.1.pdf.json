specific patterns of EMG activity during flexion and extension.\nStudy Design: Data was obtained from subjects who, on a single day, completed self-report measures of pain and pain-related fear, and were interviewed to determine demographic and pain information.\nSubjects then underwent a dynamic EMG evaluation for which they were asked to stand, then bend forward as far as possible, stay fully flexed, and return to standing.\nLumbar EMG and angle of flexion were recorded during this time.\nA flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR) was computed by comparing maximal EMG while flexing to the average EMG in full flexion.\nWhen controlling for pain and demographic factors, pain-related fear continued to be related to reduced lumbar flexion.\nConversely, pain-related fear was independently related to higher average EMG in full flexion, while angle of flexion was not significantly related.\nConclusions: Pain-related fear is significantly associated with reduced lumbar flexion, greater EMG in full flexion, and a smaller FRR.\nThe relationship between pain-related fear and EMG during flexion and extension appears to be mediated by reduced lumbar flexion.\nThese results suggest that pain-related fear is directly associated with musculoskeletal abnormalities observed among persons with chronic low back pain, as well as indirectly through limited lumbar flexion.\nThese musculoskeletal abnormalities as well as limited movement may be involved in the development and maintenance of chronic low back pain.\nIn addition, changes in musculoskeletal functioning and flexion associated with pain-related fear may warrant greater attention as part of treatment.\nC hronic low back pain (CLBP), particularly of musculoskeletal origin, has become a major focus of concern for both employers and health care professionals.\nAlthough several factors have been proposed to be responsible for or to perpetuate CLBP, little is known about the disorder.\nOne major theory, the biomechanical model, proposes that CLBP may be the result of muscle asymmetries or abnormally low levels of muscle activity.\n1 This theory suggests that abnormal electromyographic (EMG) activity is a result of poor posture and guarding that develops in response to an original injury.\n2 Several investigators proposed that this irregular muscle activity contributes to spinal instability, which in turn enhances the potential of infringement upon nerve endings and thereby produces pain.\nAnother major theory of chronic back pain is the reflexspasm model.\nThis research was supported by grant HD35893 from the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, National Institute of Child and Human Development, National Institutes of Health.\nThe model that emphasizes the contribution of psychosocial stress to reflex-spasm has been referred to as the diathesisstress12 or stress-hyperactivity model of chronic pain.\nEvidence for these various theories is mixed.\nStudies supporting the biomechanical model have found that persons with CLBP display lower EMG levels compared with controls while sitting and during movement,3,1315 as well as abnormal muscle patterns or asymmetries compared with controls.\nIn support of the reflex-spasm model, studies have found increased EMG in response to painful stimulation, and greater EMG in static postures.\n1922 Additional studies have failed to support the reflex-spasm model.\nSeveral methodological issues have been raised to explain these discrepancies, including heterogeneous groups of patients with different pathology and pain in different sites.\nMany authors encourage the evaluation of dynamic EMG activity, as EMG in static positions may not be representative of what occurs during activities of daily living.\nOne found that paraspinal muscle activity did not differ between persons with CBP and controls, nor was it related to self-reported pain intensity.\nNo relationship between EMG activity and pain was observed.\nOne pattern of abnormal muscle activity that has consistently been shown to be associated with CLBP is an absence of relaxation of the lumbar paraspinal muscles in full-flexion.\nIn healthy persons who are asked to stand quietly, the surface EMG signals from the paraspinal muscles are generally low.\nAs a person bends forward, EMG activity increases as the muscles support the trunk at a greater angle to gravity.\nNear full flexion, ligamentous support becomes more important and lumbar EMG activity drops, often to a level less than the activity recorded when standing upright.\nThis paraspinal relaxation on terminal flexion, first reported in the late 1940s by Allen,27 is known as the flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP).\nMany studies conducted among persons with CLBP indicate that the FRP is absent in this population.\nThis response has been shown to be significantly related to disability ratings and pain behavior among persons with CLBP,3132 and has been shown to be sensitive to spinal pathology such as disk herniation.\n33 Studies indicate that the FRP has good test-retest reliability, even in clinical populations.\nLittle is known about the factors that contribute to the absence of the FRP in persons with CLBP.\nAhern et al suggested that the absence of the FRP in persons with CLBP may be a result of limited lumbar flexion.\n3 Most argue that limited flexion is not responsible for this finding, as persons with CLBP can generally reach 40 degrees of flexion, where the FRP is believed to begin.\n31 However, some observe that there is substantial variability in the angle where the FRP starts.\nIn addition, due to altered body mechanics, persons with CLBP have been observed to display only 27 degrees of true lumbar flexion.\n3 Alternatively, it has been proposed that muscle EMG abnormalities may be a response to pain, as pain has been shown to have some influence on muscle firing.\n3,36 Finally, it has been suggested that changes in paraspinal activity may be a compensatory response to improve spinal stability and decrease pain during movement.\nSeveral authors have suggested that EMG abnormalities in persons with back pain may be due to pain-related fear or volitional guarding during movement.\n37 The authors predicted that muscular reactivity would be greater for persons high in pain-related fear, and that this effect would be moderated by negative affect.\nUnexpectedly, the authors found that subjects responded to the videotape with decreased muscle tension, although subjects high in pain-related fear tended to display less of a decrement compared with persons with CLBP who reported low fear.\nVlaeyen and Linton38 propose that pain-related fear and resulting muscular reactivity may be related to the development and maintenance of CLBP.\nWatson et al40 examined the relationship between painrelated fear and the flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR), defined as the ratio of maximal muscle activity in flexion to the average EMG activity in full flexion, among persons with CLBP.\nThe authors found a significant, inverse relationship between painrelated fear and the FRR, whereby persons with higher painrelated fear tended to display a lower ratio.\nIn addition, the authors found a significant increase in the FRR following a pain management program, which was significantly associated with decreased pain-related fear.\nThe authors concluded that pain-related fear promotes muscle guarding during flexion, which in turn contributes to the development and maintenance of chronic pain.\nIn the present study, we wished to directly examine the relationship between pain-related fear, as measured by the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-2 (TSK-2),41,42 and EMG activity and angle of flexion among persons with CLBP.\nExtending the findings of Watson et al,40 we wished to determine how pain-related fear influences the components of the FRR (maximum EMG in flexion and average EMG in full flexion) as well as the FRR itself.\nWe hypothesized that persons with CLBP who demonstrated higher pain-related fear would display decreased EMG levels in flexion and extension, greater EMG levels in full flexion, and a lower FRR compared with persons with CLBP who exhibited low pain-related fear.\nIn addition, we hypothesized that pain-related fear would be significantly associated with decreased flexion.\nLastly, we wished to examine whether angle of flexion might account for any observed relationship between pain-related fear and lumbar EMG by statistically examining the independent influence of painrelated fear and angle of flexion on EMG activity.\nAs painrelated fear has been shown to be associated with restricted movement,43 it is possible that fear may be related to abnormal EMG activity through limited movement or flexion.\nSubjects Participants were 76 persons with chronic (3 or more months) musculoskeletal low back pain (as diagnosed by their treating physiatrist) who presented to the University of Michigan Spine Program for evaluation and treatment.\nSubjects were recruited to participate in a larger study examining the impact of manual therapy and specific adjuvant exercise on CLBP.\nInformed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the study methods were approved by the Institutional Review Board.\nParticipants had a mean age of 40.\nThirty-four were male, and 42 were female.\n5% were involved in litigation.\nThirteen persons had previous lumbar surgery (laminectomy or discectomy).\nForty persons were working full or part-time, while 29 were not working due to pain.\nSixty-six persons were Caucasian, 7 were African-American, 2 were AsianAmerican, and 1 was Hispanic.\nPain and Demographic Information Participants were asked about their duration of pain, education, race, and other sociodemographic information such.\nFor the correlational analyses, categorical variables were dummy coded.\nPain Subjects completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)44 on the first day of assessment.\nThe MPQ measures subjective pain experience in a quantitative form, and consists of 20 groups of single word pain descriptors with the words in each group increasing in rank order intensity.\nThe Total PRI was used in the present study as the measure of self-reported pain intensity.\nParticipants were asked to rate the highest, lowest, and average level of pain on three separate 10 cm Visual Analog Scales (VASs) anchored by the statement no pain on the left and the most intense pain imaginable on the right.\nVAS pain ratings have demonstrated good reliability45,46 and concurrent validity when compared with other methods of pain measurement.\nA total score for the scale is obtained by summing the items.\nThe total score was used in the present study.\nDynamic EMGFlexion-Relaxation Ratio Subjects underwent a dynamic EMG evaluation and calculation of the FRR.\nThe signals are band pass filtered from 30 to 1000 Hz prior to RMS conversion.\nThirty-two by 22 mm pre-gelled silver/silver chloride electrodes were placed on both the right and left sides of the spine approximately 3 cm from the midline.\nOne electrode was centered at L3 vertebral body, and the other at the L5 vertebral body.\nOnce the equipment was placed on the subjects, they were asked to go through a series of movements verbally led by the examiner.\nSubjects were asked to stand upright for 2 seconds (Phase 1), then bend as far forward as they could to the count of two (Phase 2).\nAs head position has been suggested to influence EMG activity during the task,8 subjects were asked to tuck their chin into their chest as they bent forward.\nDuring Phase 3, subjects were asked to stay in full flexion for 2 seconds, then return to standing over a period of 2 seconds (Phase 4).\nData collection was performed over a period of 10 seconds to assure that all the data was captured.\nSubjects performed 5 trials, and data from the first trial was discarded as it was treated as a practice trial.\nThe gain was adjusted during this trial to produce a signal within allowable limits.\nAdditional practice trials were performed as needed to obtain an adequate signal.\nThe gain was kept constant for remaining trials.\nThe data for each subject were then divided into the 4 phases described above.\nThe data was visually inspected for integrity, and interference (spikes) were removed.\nEMG signals from the left and right sides were averaged.\nEach phase was defined based on the goniometer reading.\nAny change or stabilization in the angle by two or more degrees constituted a change in the phase.\nTo control for differences in amplification, the influence of static EMG on dynamic values, and other individual differences such as obesity that might influence the surface EMG signal, the data were normalized by dividing the data for a phase by the average EMG during Phase 1.\n29 Maximum (MAX) EMG during flexion was calculated by dividing the MAX EMG in Phase 2 by the average EMG from Phase 1.\nThe average (AVE) EMG in full flexion was calculated by dividing the AVE EMG during Phase 3 by the AVE EMG in Phase 1.\nThe FRR was computed by dividing the normalized maximum EMG during flexion by the normalized average EMG in full flexion.\nProcedure Data for the current experiment were obtained on the first day of testing from the larger study.\nInformed consent was obtained from each subject, and each subject was then interviewed to obtain demographic and pain information.\nSubjects were told that the purpose of the testing was to examine changes in pain and other self-report measures, as well as changes in muscle function while bending as a function of treatment.\nQuestionnaires were checked for thoroughness of completion.\nRESULTS Prior to examining the relationships between the EMG, flexion data, and the variables of interest, these data were checked for normalcy.\nVisual inspection of the EMG data suggested that distribution of scores were positively skewed.\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit Test was conducted on the normalized EMG Data.\nThe Z statistic for MAX angle of flexion suggested that this distribution was normal.\nThe normalized EMG data were then subjected to a logarithmic transformation to attempt to normalize the distributions, and repeat Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit Tests indicated that the data transformations were successful.\nThe sample means for the normalized, log transformed EMG data, and maximum angle of flexion are presented in Table 1.\nAs the associations between MPQ scores and VAS scores were similar, analysis of MPQ scores was dropped.\nWe were particularly interested in examining the relationship between fear and EMG and angle of flexion, in addition to pain and demographic variables that might be related to EMG activity, as these would need to be controlled for in later analyses.\nPain duration was not significantly associated with EMG or flexion.\nTo further explore the relationship between pain-related fear, angle of flexion, and EMG activity, a series of path models were constructed to examine whether pain-related fear influences EMG activity directly, or indirectly through its influence on range of motion.\nAs several demographic and pain variables displayed significant zero-order relationships to angle of flexion and the various EMG measures, they were treated as exogenous variables in the path models and were controlled for statistically.\nIn addition, a beta weight was computed for the pathway between maximum angle of flexion and EMG activity controlling for TSK-2 scores and the exogenous variables.\nFour separate models were constructed with MAX EMG in extension, AVE EMG in full flexion, MAX EMG in flexion, and the FRR as dependent measures, as pain-related fear demonstrated significant zeroorder relationships with each EMG measure.\nThe significance of the path coefficients was based on the t test of the significance of the beta weight in the regression.\nThe path models are presented in Figure 1.\nThe models that examined maximum EMG during flexion and extension as the dependent variables suggested that the relationship between pain-related fear and EMG is mediated by angle of flexion.\nThese results suggest that pain-related fear influences EMG during flexion and extension through its association with decreased range of motion.\nIn the path model examining the relationship between pain-related fear and AVE EMG in full flexion, pain-related fear demonstrated a direct relationship to increased average EMG activity in full flexion ( = 0.\nExamining the FRR as the dependent variable, the path model suggested that pain-related fear has both a direct and indirect influence on the ratio of maximum EMG during flexion to the average EMG in full flexion.\nDISCUSSION The findings of the present study indicate that painrelated fear is significantly associated with decreased lumbar flexion in persons with CLBP.\nZero-order correlations indicated that TSK-2 scores were significantly associated with lower MAX EMG during flexion and extension, and a smaller FRR.\nPath analyses conducted to examine whether range of motion mediates the relationship between pain-related fear and EMG activity suggested that pain-related fear indirectly influences maximum EMG in flexion and extension through limited flexion.\nIn addition, the path models suggested that painrelated fear was directly related to increased maximal EMG activity in full flexion, while angle of flexion was unrelated to this variable.\nWhen the FRR was examined as the dependent variable, pain-related fear displayed both a direct and indirect relationship to this variable.\nAs clinical pain was controlled for in the path analyses, the results suggest that pain-related fear is associated with range of motion and EMG independent of pain intensity.\nThere are limitations to the present study.\nFirst, we only examined muscle activity among persons with CLBP and not normal healthy persons.\nThus, it is difficult to determine whether the data reflect abnormal muscle activity.\nSecond, pain during actual bending was not assessed.\nThird, the study is cross-sectional and therefore does not allow for examination of cause-effect relationships.\nIn addition, Watson et al40 found no relationship between present pain intensity just prior to bending and the FRR.\nThe present findings replicate the findings of Watson et al40 in that a significant relationship was observed between pain-related fear and the FRR.\nThe relationship between maximal muscle activity and pain-related fear is mediated by decreased range of motion, while the relationship between fear and average EMG in full flexion was independent of range of motion.\nThus, pain-related fear has both a direct and indirect influence on the FRR, and the path analysis examining the FRR as the dependent variable supported this conclusion.\nconcluded that the relationship between pain-related fear and the FRR did not appear to be due to limited range of motion, as no significant changes in range of motion were observed before and after treatment in a pain management program despite significant increases in the FRR.\nHowever, the FRR was significantly associated with flexion at 2 sites measured prior to treatment, but not at two others.\nThe data from the present study suggest that limited flexion among persons with CLBP may be responsible for some of the previous findings related to an abnormal FRP among persons with CLBP.\nFuture studies examining dynamic EMG among persons with CLBP should consider the potential influence of angle of flexion on muscle activity, particularly during flexion and extension.\nThe present findings are consistent with the biomechanical model of chronic pain as well as previous studies that have demonstrated decreased paraspinal muscle activity during flexion among persons with CLBP, as well as increased EMG in full flexion.\n3,8,2931 The results suggest that persons with CLBP who are highly fearful not only guard when in full flexion, but also significantly limit movement.\nThese data suggest that it may be important to address both EMG abnormalities and limited lumbar flexion as part of the treatment of CLBP.\nIt is possible that high levels of pain-related fear may lead to restricted range of motion and abnormal muscle utilization patterns that may increase the likelihood of developing CLBP.\nIndeed, it has been proposed that activity avoidance may lead to muscle atrophy, which in turn promotes pain.\n52 Vlaeyen et al37 found that muscles such as the anterior tibialis were overactive during exposure to stress among persons with CLBP.\nWhile this muscle is far removed from the paraspinals to compensate during flexion, it might be beneficial to examine other nearby muscles such as the iliosoas.\nIn addition, Haig et al suggested that decreased lumbar paraspinal activity during flexion might be due to co-contraction of the abdominal muscles.\n33 Monitoring of other muscles during movement might be beneficial in examining the types of muscle activity patterns that occur among persons with CLBP.\nWhile previous studies have debated the influence of angle of flexion on EMG activity when examining the FRP, the results of the present study provide some direct examination of this issue.\nIt appears that angle of flexion impacts maximal EMG during flexion and extension, but not EMG in full flexion.\nThe finding that maximal EMG during flexion and extension is dependent on angle of flexion is consistent with research indicating a positive, linear relationship between peak torque and angle of extension on a task of isometric lumbar extension.\n53 Angle of flexion may be unrelated to EMG in full flexion as most authors argue that myoelectric silence during flexion begins around 40 degrees of flexion, and most persons with CLBP are able to achieve this degree of flexion.\nThe conclusions regarding the direct influence of painrelated fear and EMG in full flexion are based on the results of the path analyses.\nThe zero-order correlation between painrelated fear and EMG activity in full flexion was not statistically significant.\nThe discrepancy between the zero-order correlation and the path analysis suggests that one of the variables in the path model acted as a suppressor variable.\nWhile a relationship between fear and EMG activity in full flexion was not specifically examined in the Watson et al40 study, most studies examining the FRP in persons with CLBP and controls have consistently found elevated EMG in full flexion among persons with CLBP.\nIt is possible that the normalization used in the present study may have contributed to this suppression, as normalization has not been typically employed in previous studies.\nIt is also possible that the observed suppression effect is specific to this sample.\nMost prior studies examining the FRP in relation to CLBP have not normalized EMG data.\nAs deconditioning and obesity have been reported to play a role in chronic pain and are known to influence surface EMG signals,54 group differences in these variables may contribute to observed differences in EMG activity.\nIn addition, within chronic pain populations, factors such as pain-related fear may systematically vary with variables that influence surface EMG.\nFor example, it has been proposed that pain-related fear and activity avoidance lead to greater deconditioning among persons with CBP.\nIt would be interesting to examine the impact of antispasm medications on muscle activity and movement among persons with CLBP in relation to pain-related fear.\nThere is much debate regarding the physiological basis of muscle spasm, and anti-spasm medications have not been shown to have a direct impact on muscle activity.\nIn summary, pain-related fear appears to be highly associated with restricted movement and muscle activity among persons with CLBP.\nFuture studies should examine this relationship not only in persons with CLBP but also in normal, healthy controls.\nThe results of this study suggest that angle of flexion should be considered as a possible confound when examining EMG activity among clinical and normal populations.\nCause-effect relationships between pain-related fear, flexion, and muscle activity need to be established.\nAltering pain-related fear, restrictions in movement, and accompanying musculoskeletal changes may be beneficial in the treatment of CLBP.\nMuscle action potentials used in the study of dynamic anatomy."}
