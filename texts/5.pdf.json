{"title": "Peripheral_Stimulus.txt", "contents": "Structural abnormalities of several different anatomic structures can be responsible for lumbar spine pain\nSymptoms are typically associated with pathological alterations in the intervertebral disc, facet joints, sacroiliac joints, vertebral endplates, vertebral bodies, and/or the paraspinal muscles, although the reversethose pathological alterations regularly predict painis not necessarily true\nPainful pathologic features typically include matrix damage, neovascularization, neoinnervation, and inflammation\nSome of these features may be detectable using advanced imaging techniques\nFour studies describe data for peripheral tissue dysfunction including disc (two RPF with little SOE confidence), vertebra (one RPF with little SOE confidence), and facets (one RPF with little SOE confidence) in relation to cLBP classification, pain severity and disability by questionnaire\nLocal inflammatory changes and loading of sensitized nociceptors are potential mechanisms\n"}
