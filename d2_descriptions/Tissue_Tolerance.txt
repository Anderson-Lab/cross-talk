Spinal loading can become problematic when the magnitude and duration exceed the tolerance of the active and passive stabilizers. Cumulative trauma can lead to the accumulation of structural damage when applied stresses exceed tissue strength (material properties) and tissue repair capability (biologic activity). Tissue inflammation, neoinnervation, and pain can result. The biochemical milieu of diabetes (hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia) can facilitate tissue damage mainly due to detrimental effects on blood vessels leading to reduced muscle blood flow and increased likelihood of disc degeneration.

None of the cites studies reported on load or tissue tolerance.
