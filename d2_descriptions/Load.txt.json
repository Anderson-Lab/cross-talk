{"title": "Load.txt", "contents": "Muscle and gravity loads cause the lumbar spine to be one of the most highly stressed structures in the body\nLoading induces a combination of compression, bending, torsion, and shear that vary from level-to-level\nSpinal loads induce stresses within the various subtissues, that can be anabolic (stimulate remodeling via cell-mediated processes) or catabolic (induce damage and inflammation)\nObesity may contribute to increased biomechanical loading of spinal joints\n"}
