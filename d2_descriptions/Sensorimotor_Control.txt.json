{"title": "Sensorimotor_Control.txt", "contents": "The spinal column is biomechanically stabilized by three subsystems: 1) passive subsystem that includes bone, cartilage, ligaments, intervertebral disc; 2) active subsystem that includes the paraspinal muscles; and 3) the neural control subsystem\nThese subsystems are often conceptualized separately, but they are functionally interdependent\nMotor control and function include muscle recruitment, strength, and endurance\nAn important feedback component of neuromotor control is proprioception, which refers to afferent information arising from internal peripheral areas that contribute to postural control, joint stability, and several conscious sensations\nMovement and control disorders presumably lead to a proprioceptive deficit, because of stress on local muscle spindles and joint receptors in the painful area resulting from stress to a joint caused by an individuals maladaptive movement\nSubsequently, abnormal joint and tissue loading during daily activities and postures may affect local proprioceptors and maintain this vicious cycle\nChanges in muscle activity have been linked to spinal pain (muscle-tension or pain-spasm-pain model) or restriction of spinal motion (pain adaptation)\n\nFive studies reported data related to sensorimotor control, including anticipatory postural adjustments (one RPF with substantial SOE confidence), compensatory postural adjustments (one RPF with substantial SOE confidence), proprioception (two RPF with little SOE confidence), lumbar repositioning error (one RPF with little SOE confidence), and trunk strength and mobility (one RPF with little SOE confidence) in relation to cLBP classification (yes/no), and pain severity or disability assessed by questionnaire\nThe authors hypothesize that movement control disorders cause spine tissue overloading with increased risk for nociceptive activation\n"}
