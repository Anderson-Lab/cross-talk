{"title": "Physical_Activity.txt", "contents": "Physical activity imposes fluctuating loads and movements onto the spine\nLiterature has demonstrated a dose-dependent influence of loading, where both sedentary and strenuous activities are thought to be detrimental\nPhysical activity categories may include occupational, recreational, and sports related\nThe World Health Organization defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle that results in a substantial increase over the resting energy expenditure\nWhere disability focuses on what people cannot do, the concept of physical activity focuses on what people are able to do or actually do in daily living\n\nThree studies reported data for physical functioning (two RPF with little SOE confidence) and activity (two RPF with little to some SOE confidence)as assessed by questionnaire or accelerometry in relation to work status, disability, and pain severity\nPotential mechanisms discussed include the fear-avoidance or avoidance-endurance models, hypothesizing that patients avoid activities due to fear of reinjury that, in turn, leads to deconditioning and further disability\n"}
