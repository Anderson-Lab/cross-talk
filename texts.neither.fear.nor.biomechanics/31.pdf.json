Irvine, CA.\nABSTRACT Anatomical, physiological, and lesion data implicate multiple cortical regions in the complex experience of pain.\nThese regions include primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and regions of the frontal cortex.\nNevertheless, the role of different cortical areas in pain processing is controversial, particularly that of primary somatosensory cortex (S1).\nHuman brain-imaging studies do not consistently reveal painrelated activation of S1, and older studies of cortical lesions and cortical stimulation in humans did not uncover a clear role of S1 in the pain experience.\nWhereas studies from a number of laboratories show that S1 is activated during the presentation of noxious stimuli as well as in association with some pathological pain states, others do not report such activation.\nFirst, we have evidence demonstrating that S1 activation is highly modulated by cognitive factors that alter pain perception, including attention and previous experience.\nSecond, the precise somatotopic organization of S1 may lead to small focal activations, which are degraded by sulcal anatomical variability when averaging data across subjects.\nThird, the probable mixed excitatory and inhibitory effects of nociceptive input to S1 could be disparately represented in different experimental paradigms.\nWe conclude that, when these factors are taken into account, the bulk of the evidence now strongly supports a prominent and highly modulated role for S1 cortex in the sensory aspects of pain, including localization and discrimination of pain intensity.\nThe role of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in pain perception has long been in dispute.\nIn the early 20th century, Head and Holmes (1) observed that patients with longstanding cortical lesions did not show deficits in pain perception.\nSimilarly, Penfield and Boldrey (2), based on studies of electrical stimulation of patients exposed cerebral cortices during epilepsy surgery, concluded that pain probably has little or no cortical representation.\nIn more recent studies of S1 cortex in monkeys, single-cell recordings in both anesthetized (3) and awake (4) monkeys revealed so few nociceptive neurons that their functional significance was uncertain.\nOther evidence suggests that S1 cortex may indeed play an important role in pain perception.\nDespite the lack of profound deficits in pain perception after widespread cortical lesions, patients do show at least transient deficits following cortical lesions (1, 5).\nAdditionally, despite the small numbers of nociceptive neurons observed in monkey S1 cortex, their responses parallel pain perception in humans (10, 11).\nFor example, by using optical imaging and neuronal recording techniques, Tommerdahl et al.\n(11) showed that nociceptive activity in area 3a of S1 cortex exhibited slow temporal summation and poststimulus response persistence after repeated cutaneous heat stimulation, which parallel perceptual consequences of the stimulation in humans.\nFinally, bilateral ablation of S1 cortex in monkeys disrupts their ability to discriminate intensities of noxious heat (D.\nFindings from human brain imaging studies have produced inconsistent results pertaining to the role of S1 cortex in pain perception.\nThe first three modern brain imaging studies of pain, published in the early 1990s, produced vastly different results in terms of S1 cortex.\nBy using positron emission tomography (PET) and repeated 5-sec heat stimuli presented to six spots on the arm, Talbot et al.\n(12) found a significant activation focus in S1 cortex contralateral to the stimulated arm.\nFinally, by using single photon-emission computed tomography, Apkarian et al.\nJones and colleagues (15, 16) postulated that the experimental procedures used by Talbot et al.\nThey further postulated that the presence or absence of pain, itself, is probably not a main determinant of S1 activation.\nMore recent studies support the idea that attention can significantly modulate pain-evoked S1 activity, but little evidence supports the premise that pain is not a major determinant of S1 activity during painful stimulation.\nTable 1 shows the methods and results of a number of human brain imaging studies of pain, by using PET, single photonemission computed tomography, functional MRI, and magnetoencephalographic imaging.\nIn the various studies, pain stimuli include phasic and tonic heat, cold, chemical irritants, electric shock, ischemia, visceral distension, headache, and neuropathic pain.\nAs can be seen in Table 1, there is little consistency among the studies as to whether S1 is activated by pain.\nSome studies involving thermal, chemical, or electrical stimulation reveal S1 activation, whereas others using similar stimuli do not.\nAbbreviations: S1, primary somatosensory cortex; PET, positron emission tomography; rCBF, regional cerebral blood flow.\ndifferential results include (i) influences of cognitive modulation in S1 activity; (ii) averaging-related degradation of the signal because of variability of sulcal anatomy; (iii) a possible combination of excitatory and inhibitory effects of nociceptive input to S1; and (iv) differences in statistical analyses and power.\nCognitive Modulation of S1 Activity.\nAs proposed by Jones and colleagues (15, 16), S1 pain-related activation is highly modulated by cognitive factors that alter pain perception, including attention and previous experience.\n1 shows the results of this study, in which we used PET H215O bolus methods to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in nine subjects while they discriminated changes in thermal intensity or auditory frequency.\n5C or warm, 3238C on

pain-related activity, i.\nPain intensity was rated higher in the thermal than in the auditory task (50.\nIn this experiment, the behavioral task used to direct attention toward the thermal stimuli involved the detection of a small change in the intensity of the heat stimulus.\nThis task probably served to specifically direct the subjects attention to sensory aspects of the pain, rather than to the unpleasantness or suffering.\nBy using hypnosis, we found that suggestions specifically directed toward increasing or decreasing the perceived intensity of the burning pain sensation produced by submerging a subjects hand in painfully hot water modulated painrelated activity in S1 (R.\n12 PET H215O Healthy 8 Thermode 1 cm2 42, 4748C Yes Jones et al.\n25 PET H215O Healthy 9 Thermode, 1 cm2 34,

hypnotic suggestions may have produced long-term changes in the subjects neural processing of pain.\nAt least a week before participating in a PET scanning session, all subjects received the same hypnotic induction, suggestions, and painful stimuli that were to be used during the scanning experiment.\nIn subsequent PET sessions, two scans using the painful heat and two using the nonpainful warm control stimulus were performed before the subjects underwent hypnotic induction and suggestions.\nDuring these four scans, the subjects were simply instructed to relax and attend to the thermal stimulusa control situation for identifying regions that could be examined for modulation related to hypnotic suggestions given in subsequent scans.\nAlthough subjects in the two hypnosis experiments produced similar ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness during these control scans, those previously trained to attend to the intensity of the painful stimuli showed substantially greater pain-related activity in S1 than did those who had been trained to attend to the unpleasantness of those stimuli [Fig.\nAttentional modulation within S1 cortex is not restricted to pain-related activity.\nOther investigators have found that rCBF in S1, evoked by tactile stimuli, is reduced when subjects attend to another stimulus modality (18).\nSimilarly, neuronal recordings in S1 cortex of trained monkeys reveal low-threshold neurons whose activity is enhanced by attention to the tactile stimulus (19, 20).\nDespite the extensive nature of attentional modulation of S1 activity, there is little evidence that attention activates S1 neurons without the concurrent presence of sensory-evoked activation.\nhas been shown to produce decreases in S1 rCBF (51) rather than increases in rCBF that would reflect excitatory neuronal activity.\nBoth monkey and human data indicate that nociceptive activity in S1 cortex is somatotopically organized.\nThe somatotopic organization of S1 cortex probably results in a small focal activation evoked by a localized pain stimulus.\n3 shows the focal activation produced in S1 cortex of three individual subjects when the leg was stimulated with noxious heat (B.\nThe images show regions activated during stimulation with painful heat, as compared with that observed during nonpainful warm.\n3 also shows that the pain-related S1 activation sites, although on the posterior bank of the central sulcus in all subjects, varied in terms of their stereotaxic coordinates, suggesting small intersubject differences in the localization of pain-related activity.\n(11) found in monkey S1 cortex that the presence of noxious heat reduced the intrinsic optical-imaging signal evoked by low-threshold mechanical stimulation of the skin.\nPain-related activity when attention is directed to the painful heat stimulus (Left) or to an auditory stimulus (Center) is revealed by subtracting PET data recorded when a warm stimulus (3238C) was presented from those recorded when a painfully hot stimulus (46.\n5C) was presented during each attentional state.\nHorizontal and coronal slices through S1 are centered at the activation peaks.\nRed circles surround the region of S1.\nWhereas there was a significant activation of S1 when subjects attended to the painful stimulus (Left), there was no significant activation when subjects attended to the auditory stimulus (Center).\nHowever, there was a subsignificant activation in S1 during the auditory task, as shown in the Inset.\nThe direct comparison of pain in the two attentional conditions (Right) shows a significant difference in pain-related S1 activity during the two attentional states.\nThese data are consistent with the findings of Apkarian et al.\n(14), which showed a decrease in blood flow to S1 cortex in human subjects during the presentation of a tonic heat stimulus.\nConsonant with the idea that noxious stimulation produces inhibition of tactile sensitivity in S1 cortex are psychophysical data showing that the presence of pain reduces tactile perception (22).\nOther evidence suggests that the inhibition of S1 tactile activity by noxious stimuli may take place at lower levels of the neuraxis rather than through a direct inhibitory influence at the level of S1.\nIn awake monkeys, the spontaneous activity of low-threshold neurons in the ventroposterior thalamus is inhibited by topical application of capsaicin, which specifically excites C fibers (C.\nSimilarly, capsaicin sometimes reduces the responses of spinothalamic tract neurons to noxious heat stimulation (23).\nThus, when a painful stimulus is presented in a human brain imaging study, the net effect of exciting some neurons and inhibiting the spontaneous activity of others could have different effects on rCBF (as measured by PET) or on venous blood oxygenation (as measured by functional MRI), depending on such variables as timing, duration, location, and intensity of the painful stimulus.\nIn human brain imaging studies, many procedural variables can influence the resultant data.\nAnalytical techniques are not standardized across laboratories or across imaging methods.\nFor example, different approaches are used to compare stimulation conditions, including subtraction and regression comparisons across scans.\nInstructions to the subjects, which can influence the cognitive state, vary among studies, as does the timing of stimulus variables.\nThe statistical analyses, including methods.\nfor calculating variance and assumptions about the nature of the data, also differ among laboratories.\nAlthough all analyses rely on some type of statistical determination of significance, the method of accounting for multiple comparisons varies, and thus the criteria for identifying an activation as significant are not uniform across studies.\nFinally, the power of any statistical test is influenced by the number of subjects studied, which is another factor that varies greatly among studies.\nAs with any statistical test, the interpretation of negative results must be performed with caution.\nBoth images represent data from control scans, in which no hypnotic suggestions were given.\nEach image represents the subtraction of PET data recorded when the hand was submerged in thermally neutral water (35C) from data recorded when the hand was submerged in painfully hot water (47C).\nPET data were averaged across 10 experimental sessions in the sensory study (Upper) and, in a different group of subjects, 11 experimental sessions in the affective study (Lower).\nCoronal slices through S1 are centered at the activation peaks, and red circles surround the region of S1.\nThermal stimuli were applied to the left calf on separate runs.\nThermal runs consisted of 9 s alternating cycles of rest, painful (4546C), rest, and neutral (35 36C) stimulation by using a 9 cm2 thermode.\nActivation maps were generated by using Spearmans rank order correlation, comparing painful to neutral heat.\nThe coronal and horizontal slices through S1 are centered at the activation peaks, and red circles surround the region of S1.\nDespite the wide methodological and analytical variation in human brain imaging studies of pain, there is surprising consistency in the activation of a number of brain regions, including anterior cingulate and insular cortices.\nAlthough the observation of pain-related activation in S1 is somewhat less consistent, the fact that at least half of the human brain imaging studies have identified significant activation of this region when subjects perceive pain suggests that S1 has a significant role in nociceptive processing.\nWhat Is the Role of S1 in Pain Processing? Anatomical, neurophysiological, and imaging data confirm a role of S1 cortex in pain processing.\nOverall, the findings support the traditional view that S1 is primarily involved in discriminative aspects of somatic sensation and extends this view to include discriminative aspects of somatic stimulation that is potentially tissue-damaging, e.\nSingle neurons in monkey S1 code stimulus intensity, location, and duration, and their activity correlates with human perception.\nHuman imaging studies show activation of S1 by a range of noxious stimuli, including capsaicin, which selectively activates C fibers.\nThese studies also confirm the somatotopic organization of S1 pain responses, thus supporting the role of S1 in pain localization.\nOther imaging data that implicate S1 in the sensory aspect of pain perception are findings that S1 activation is modulated by cognitive manipulations that alter perceived pain intensity but not by manipulations that alter unpleasantness, independent of pain intensity.\nNevertheless, despite the probable role of S1 in the encoding of the various sensory features of pain, a considerable amount of evidence suggests that nociceptive input to S1 may also serve to modulate tactile perception, described by Apkarian et al.\nThus, S1 cortex may be involved in both perception and modulation of both painful and nonpainful somatosensory sensations.\nWe wish to express our appreciation to Ms.\nFrancine Belanger for her help in preparing this manuscript and to Dr.\nPierre Rainville for his intellectual and technical contributions to these studies.\nImaging studies were performed at the Montreal Neurological Institute with the help and expertise of the its staff.\nThis research is supported by operating grants from the Canadian Medical Research Council awarded to M.\n(1992) Science 255, 215215.\n(1997) Science 227, 968971.\n(1998) Neuroscience, 90, 13771392.\n(1994) Pain 56, 167173.\n(1995) Pain 63, 225236.\n(1995) Pain 64, 303314.\n(1995) NeuroReport 7, 321325.\n(1996) Nature (London) 384, 258260.\n(1996) Pain 67, 5968.\n(1997) Pain 70, 185191.\n(1997) Gastroenterology 112, 6472.\n(1997) NeuroReport 8, 555559.\n(1998) Brain 121, 931947.\n(1998) Pain 74, 6166.\n(1998) Pain 76, 223229.\nUSA 96 (1999) 7709."}
