{"title": "21.pdf", "contents": "This paper provides an analysis of the literature on trunk muscle recruitment in low-back pain patients.\nTwo models proposed in the literature, the painspasmpain model and the pain adaptation model, yield conflicting predictions on how lowback pain would affect trunk muscle recruitment in various activities.\nThe two models are outlined and evidence for the two from neurophsysiological studies is reviewed.\nSubsequently, specific predictions with respect to changes in activation of the lumbar extensor musculature are derived from both models.\nThese predictions are compared to the results from 30 clinical studies and three induced pain studies retrieved in a comprehensive literature search.\nNeither of the two models is unequivocally supported by the literature.\nThese data and further data on timing of muscle activity and load sharing between muscles suggest an alternative model to explain the alterations of trunk muscle recruitment due to low-back pain.\nIt is proposed that motor control changes in patients are functional in that they enhance spinal stability.\nLow-back pain (LBP) is one of the most prevalent and costly health problems in western society [7].\nIn spite of extensive research efforts, the causes of LBP are still elusive and treatment effects are unsatisfactory.\nIt is often suggested that the occurrence of LBP should be accepted as a fact of life and efforts of researchers and clinicians should focus on preventing LBP from becoming chronic rather than at prevention of first-time occurrence [7].\nTo design a rational program for secondary prevention, it needs to be established whether behavioral responses displayed by patients should be considered adaptive and supportive of recovery or as adverse and contributing to a vicious cycle leading to chronicity.\nfocuses on the interpretation of changes in trunk muscle activity in LBP patients.\nIn contrast, the pain adaptation model postulates that pain reduces activation of muscles when active as agonists and increases activation of muscles when active as antagonists.\nThis will reduce movement velocity and range of motion, which would prevent mechanical provocation of pain in damaged tissues and further damage of these tissues [78].\nIt is striking that proponents of both models have found evidence supporting their interpretation in reviews of the literature on electromyographically recorded back muscle activation in LBP patients [78,110].\nThe aim of the present paper therefore is to more systematically review the literature on effects of clinical and experimentally induced LBP on trunk muscle activation in terms of levels of activation, the timing of activation, and load sharing between muscles.\nactivation will be derived for each model.\nSecond, studies on trunk muscle activation in LBP patients will be reviewed.\nThe results from the studies reviewed will be compared to the model predictions.\nFinally, an alternative interpretation for the experimental results based on spinal instability as an important component of LBP will be proposed.\nPain occurring immediately after acute trauma is often accompanied by intense contractions of muscles surrounding the injured structures.\nThis is thought to be functional, since it will prevent motion of the injured structures.\nIn clinical practice, it is often assumed that similar muscular reactions occur following non-traumatic pain.\nIn these cases, it is not the functional, adaptive nature of such a response that is emphasized but rather its possible adverse consequences.\nThe pain spasmpain model was first formally proposed by Travell [129].\nTravell suggested that pain would lead to muscular hyperactivity referred to as spasm, which in turn will cause pain.\nTreatment modalities based on this model involve relaxation and stretching of muscles.\nMost tissues in the low back, including, muscle, tendon, ligament, bone, endplate, and annulus fibrosus, are innervated by thin myelinated and unmyelinated fibers with free nerve endings.\nThese afferents, which are considered to be nociceptors, enter the posterior horn, from where they project onto higher centers giving rise to the perception of pain.\nWyke [138] has suggested that these projections form the basis of a reflexive hyperactivity of back muscles in response to pain.\nJohansson and Sojka [59] have proposed an alternative neural pathway to form the basis of a painspasmpain loop.\nThey proposed that nociceptors affect the output of muscle spindles via direct excitatory projections on the gamma motorneurons.\nThe increased muscle spindle output will cause hyperexcitability of the alpha motorneuron pool.\nThe common denominator in the two theories is the hyperexcitability of the alpha motorneuron pool, which could form the basis for more sustained and more intense muscle activity in pain patients as compared to controls.\nThis sustained activity is in turn expected to cause pain due to the accumulation in the muscles of for example arachidonic acid, bradykinin, potassium and lactate.\nThese substances have been shown to have strong excitatory effects on nociceptors in muscle tissue [66,91].\nSeveral basic neurophysiological studies have been performed to verify the existence of the pathways proposed to underlie the painspasmpain cycle.\nEvidence of hyperexcitability of the alpha motorneuron pool due to nociceptive stimuli was found in cats after mechanical or chemical noxious stimulation of facet joints, fascia, ligaments, periosteum, and muscle.\nThe hyperexcitability was shown in the form of short erratic bursts of paraspinal muscle activity [56,101,118,119,123,137].\nIn pigs, paraspinal muscle activity was found to increase during electrical stimulation of the intervertebral disc and facet joints [54].\nIn rat, the flexion reflex was increased following induction of muscle pain [134].\nLikewise resting EMG levels in rat masticatory muscles were found to be increased after induction of pain.\nThis effect did however last only up to 10 min.\nExperimental results in humans are limited.\nThe amplitude of the Hofmanns reflex, which is an indicator of alpha motorneuron excitability, was not increased after injection of hypertonic saline in the calf muscles [88].\nHowever, resting EMG levels were increased in human masticatory muscles [124], although the effect was only short-lived.\nPart of the neurophysiological studies inspired by the painspasmpain model focused on the pathway proposed by Johansson and Sojka [59], by looking at the effects of nociceptive afference on muscle spindle activity.\nAn increased output of muscle spindles in cat hind leg and neck muscles, as a consequence of nociceptive stimuli, was found in a range of experiments [30,76,102,103].\nHowever, an experiment in which myositis was induced in the hind leg of the cat showed a decreased activity of gamma motorneurons [92].\nAlso in cat back muscles no increased gamma motorneuron activity was found after injection of bradykinin and capsaicin [65].\nInflammation of the knee joint produced mixed excitatory and inhibitory effects on gamma motorneurons in cats [42].\nory muscles, the stretch reflex, which is mediated by muscle spindle afferents, was found to be enhanced after injection of hypertonic saline [88,125].\nHowever, in back muscles no enhancement of stretch reflexes was found after hypertonic saline injection [141].\nIn addition, during walking the stretch reflex in the calf muscles was unaffected by induced pain [87].\nIn addition, most of this work involved animal experiments with anesthetized or decerebrate animals, greatly reducing or excluding any influence from the brain.\nThe pain-adaptation model (see below) states that the effects of peripheral projections of nociceptors onto alpha motorneurons are modulated by central nervous influences related to voluntary activity.\nFurthermore, it has been suggested that higher levels of muscle activation can occur as part of a response to pain as a psychological stressor [57].\nTherefore, testing the model with data obtained in studies of induced or clinical pain in awake humans may provide further information.\nThe basic tenet in the painspasmpain model is that pain will result in more sustained and increased muscle activation.\nThe model predicts that, in every submaximal task as well as in rest, muscle activation will be higher in patients as compared to healthy individuals.\nBy mechanical necessity this implies that cocontraction of agonist and antagonist muscles occurs in the patients.\nDuring maximum efforts, patients are predicted to attain the same level of muscle activation as controls, with however a lower moment production due to the antagonistic cocontraction.\nThe pain-adaptation model was proposed by Lund et al.\n[78] to account for clinical findings on muscle activity in pain syndromes.\nThe model states that pain decreases the activation of muscles when active as agonists and increases it when the muscle is active as antagonist [78].\nThe effects of such a control strategy would be that movement velocity is reduced and movement excursions are limited.\nThese kinematic effects are believed to prevent pain provocation.\nNeural pathway suggested to form the basis of the pain-adaptation model.\nFeedback of nociceptive afferents (N) can via excitatory interneurons (E) or inhibitory interneurons (I) excite or inhibit the alpha motorneuron ().\nWhether the output of inhibitory or excitatory interneurons dominates depends on the motor command.\nThis nociceptive feedback suppresses the output of excitatory interneurons projecting on the agonists and of inhibitory interneurons projecting on the antagonists, resulting in a reduced activation of agonists and increased activation of antagonists.\nDirect excitation of the motor neurons of the agonist and at a lower level of the antagonist by the motor command is illustrated by the thick and thin curved arrows respectively.\nThe pain-adaptation model has motivated several neurophysiological studies addressing the effects of induced pain.\nSchwartz and Lund [113] found noxious pressure to cause changes in EMG and kinematics during cyclic jaw movements in decerebrate rabbits, which were consistent with the pain adaptation model.\nIn an induced pain condition postural activity of the jaw muscles was increased with respect to baseline.\nThus, in line with the model no consistent evidence for an effect of pain on resting activity of these muscles was found.\nJaw kinematics were affected by pain in accordance with the models predictions [120].\nClear evidence in support of the pain-adaptation model was found in a study by Graven-Nielsen et al.\nInduced pain in human gastrocnemius muscle was found to decrease the activity of this muscle during gait, while the activity of the tibialis anterior, its antagonist, increased.\nFurthermore, motor unit firing rates were found to decrease in human forearm muscles after injection of hypertonic saline [14].\nThe pain-adaptation model predicts muscle activation to be reduced in agonists and increased in antagonists, irrespective of the level of exercise.\n[78] used the term antagonists to refer to muscles that are lengthening and agonists to refer to muscles that are shortening.\nThis interpretation is based on the predicted effects on kinematics.\nAn alternative definition of antagonist and agonist roles is based on the sign of the moment produced by the muscle relative to the sign of the net moment [53].\nThis definition does clearly define agonists and antagonists in isometric as well as dynamic contractions.\nThe implications of this definition may clearly deviate from the definition based on shortening versus lengthening.\nThe fact that the originators of the model interpreted unchanged activity in static tasks as supportive of the model [121], is in line with our interpretation.\nFollowing this interpretation, the model predictions are given in Table 2.\nThis review was based on a literature search in PubMed using the search terms low-back pain and muscle activity or low-back pain and electromyography and several similar combinations.\nThe references thus retrieved were screened on the basis of titles and abstracts and those papers apparently fulfilling our inclusion criteria (see below) were selected for further study.\nTo be included studies had to be published in peerreviewed journals in the English language.\nThe study had to comprise a statistical comparison of trunk muscle activation (EMG amplitude, timing or recruitment pattern) between LBP patients and controls, or between an induced back pain condition and a no back pain condition.\nThe most important issue in this respect was the normalization of EMG amplitudes.\nIn general, absolute EMG amplitudes depend on many factors unrelated to the level of muscle activation, such as thickness of tissues overlying the muscle.\nConsequently, a systematic between-group difference may be expected when patients and controls are not carefully matched.\nPatients will tend to be less physically active than controls, which could cause a difference in thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer.\nTo obtain a signal independent of such factors, normalization of EMG amplitudes to the amplitudes obtained in maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) is often used.\nHowever, in patients this procedure is considered unreliable, since patients are usually unwilling or unable to perform maximum contractions [12].\nNormalization to submaximal contractions does not provide a solution, because in patients the EMG amplitudes during these submaximal tests can be expected to be similarly affected as the levels during the experimental task.\nTherefore, non-normalized EMG amplitudes are to be preferred in clinical studies.\nHowever, this will result in a low power due to the random variance in raw EMG amplitudes, where group size is inadequate and may even result in a bias where subject groups are not matched with respect to factors like body mass, body mass index, or skinfold thickness.\nA relatively small number of studies was retrieved that dealt with timing of muscle activation and patterns of load sharing between muscles.\nThese were separately reviewed in a more qualitative way.\nEffects of clinical pain on EMG amplitudes.\nOf the total number of 44 studies retrieved fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 30 reported a comparison of lumbar erector spinae (LES) EMG amplitudes between.\nThis material was used for testing the predictions of the painspasmpain model and the pain-adaptation model.\nThis classification made it necessary to include two extra categories.\nFurthermore, a number of studies reported on EMG amplitudes averaged over movement cycles, comprising an eccentric and concentric part.\nThese tasks would comprise two separate classifications in Tables 1 and 2, for which the predictions of the pain-adaptation model diverged.\nTherefore, these studies were also summarized as a separate class (task 3/4).\nThe classifications of the experimental tasks in the 30 studies and the outcomes have been summarized in Table 4.\nThe majority of studies involved measurements of EMG in rest postures, mainly standing and sitting.\nVery few studies dealt with maximal exertions.\nNeither of the two models is consistently supported by the literature summarized in Table 4.\nMost clearly diverging predictions by the two models are made regarding rest postures and submaximal concentric contractions.\nFor rest postures, the pain adaptation model predicts no change in activation and the painspasm pain model predicts an increased activation.\nRegarding submaximal concentric contractions, the pain-adaptation model predicts decreased activation and the pain spasmpain model predicts increased activation.\nFocusing on the first of these tasks, the results appear more in line with the predictions of the pain-adaptation model.\nRegarding concentric contractions no clear trend is discernible.\nThe trend in studies on submaximal isometric exertions appears in line with the general idea behind the pain-adaptation model that activation of agonistic muscles is reduced, though not when using a definition of agonistic activity based on movement direction.\nIt is important to note that part of the support for the pain-adaptation model relies on predictions of equal muscle activation in patients and controls.\nOf course, this equality cannot be statistically assessed.\nMany of the results on the first row (equal EMG amplitudes) in Table 4 could be due to a lack of discriminative power of the studies concerned.\nWe therefore omitted studies with a lack of power due to low subject numbers.\nThe cut-off points for low power were set at 25 subjects per group, when groups were not matched and 15 subjects per group when groups were matched (11 studies were omitted).\nThe former figure was based on a conservative estimate for the coefficient of variation between subjects of 25%, a power of 0.\nNormalization may lead to biased results, therefore also studies in which normalization of EMG or exertion levels might account for the (lack of) effects were omitted (six studies of which three also had a low number of subjects).\nThe results of the remaining studies are shown in Table 5.\nThe overview in Table 5 shows two classes of tasks for which fairly strong evidence exists that increased muscle activation can occur in the patient group, i.\nin rest postures and in full flexion of the trunk.\nIn rest postures, this finding appears dependent on the type of posture even within the same population (see studies 4 and 5).\nIn full flexion, most healthy subjects show complete electromyographical silence of the LES.\nThis phenomenon is called flexionrelaxation.\nIn many patients flexionrelaxation is absent.\nThese findings appear to contradict the pain-adaptation model.\nAn early study on the effects of pain induced by the injection of hypertonic saline in the LES reported an increase of the EMG amplitude of this muscles with increasing pain intensity and a subsequent reduction in EMG amplitude with diminishing pain [21].\nTable 3

spinae during walking.\nThey found a significant increase in activation, which was most pronounced during the ipsilateral swing phase.\nDuring the double-support phase LES activation was found to be reduced.\n[141] tested subjects in trunk flexion and extension movements.\nDuring flexion, the LES activation appeared unchanged after.\nIn full flexion, increased activity was found on the injected painful and noninjected painless side, which was associated with a reduced range of motion.\nHowever, when subjects overcame this limitation of the range of motion by instruction and feedback, the increase in activity on the painful side remained.\nDuring re-extension the LES activation was found to be reduced, this effect also remained on the painful side when the subject was guided to perform the movement identical to the painless control movement.\nThe results of the studies showed no consistent support for either of the two models.\nEffects of clinical pain on timing of muscle activation.\nNine studies were retrieved that focused on effects of clinical pain on timing of trunk muscle activation.\nHemborg and Moritz [43] found a longer period of LES activation during lifting and lowering of loads.\nThis effect may be associated with the absence of flexionrelaxation in patients.\n[73], studied the recruitment order of the LES and the hip extensors (gluteus maximus and hamstrings) during flexionextension movements.\nOnly the duration of gluteus activity was reduced in patients.\nHodges and coworkers performed a number of studies on timing of trunk muscle activation prior to and shortly after rapid voluntary movements of the limbs.\nAnticipatory activation of the transversus abdominus muscle was a consistent finding in the controls, but was absent in the patients.\nIn general trunk muscle activation in the patients was delayed.\nSudden perturbations of trunk posture showed delayed responses of the trunk muscles both in a sudden release experiment [106] and sudden loading experiments [82].\nThe amplitude of the LES response to sudden loading also was reduced.\nShort latency reflexes in the LES in response to sudden upper limb loading appeared unaffected, but in contrast to controls the latency was not shortened when subjects anticipated the perturbation [74].\nAgain these studies do not consistently support either of the two models.\nThe results found by Hemborg and Moritz [43] appear more in line with the painspasm pain model, whereas the results of the perturbation experiment could be considered more in line with the pain-adaptation model in the sense that reduced excitability was found.\nEffects of clinical pain on load sharing between muscles.\nLoad sharing between muscles was studied in nine of the studies retrieved.\nSeven of these focused on left/right differences in LES activation.\nAlexiev [5] reported a significant difference between painful and painless sides in patients, with lower activation on the painful side, when exerting isometrically against resistance.\nNo asymmetry in the controls was found, but groups were not directly compared.\n[52] reported significantly more asymmetry in muscle activation during standing in patients as compared to controls.\nA similar trend, which did not reach significance, was reported by Cram and Steger [24].\nTriano and Luttges [130] reported significantly more asymmetry of paraspinal EMG amplitudes.\nin LBP patients than in controls during several static tasks (standing, sitting, trunk flexion).\nNo significant differences were found in a study on standing [3] and a study on gait [10].\nAlso with unilaterally induced pain no left/right difference in LES activation during gait emerged [10].\n[39] found more asymmetric activation in patients than in controls during ramp contractions.\nIn the patients, the temporal pattern of activation on each side was highly irregular without covariation of the moment produced.\nThis suggests that load sharing was variable over time in the patient group.\n[97] studied load sharing between abdominal muscles during an exercise called abdominal hollowing.\nAlthough activation levels of the internal oblique and rectus abdominus muscles were not different between patients and controls, the ratio of the two was different with a higher activation of rectus abdominus relative to the internal oblique in the patient group.\nWe recently studied the same ratio during free planar motions through the upright posture and during ramp contractions [26].\nNo differences between patients and matched controls were found.\nIn contrast, we did find consistent evidence in the ramp contractions and planar motions that the LES was more active relative to the thoracic erector spinae in the patient group as compared to the control group.\nIn the free motions ratios of antagonist over agonist EMG amplitudes were higher in the patients, indicating more cocontraction.\nSimulation with a mechanical model suggested that these changed recruitment patterns would enhance spinal stability in the patient group.\nThe literature reviewed here reveals that neither one of the two models adequately predicts the effects of back pain on trunk muscle activation.\nIn some cases evidence for reduced activation is found in line with the painadaptation model and in conflict with the painspasm pain model.\nThese changes appear to be adaptive in that heavy exertion of painful muscles and high accelerations that may impose a risk of pain provocation are avoided.\nHowever, in other cases increased activation is found, conflicting with the prediction of the pain-adaptation model.\nMoreover, the wide variance in results within and between subjects appears irreconcilable with the hardwired neural pathway proposed in the pain-adaptation model.\nIn addition, some of the data reviewed indicate that pain may in some cases lead to disturbances of motor control, which are not likely to be adaptive, such as for instance left/right asymmetry of LES activation and the erratic temporal pattern of LES activation reported by Grabiner et al.\nAs we will argue below, a loss of control may actually be one of the reasons why muscle activation patterns are adapted.\nWe suggest that instances of increased activation may be adaptive in nature.\nThe nature of these adaptations however appears much more complicated than suggested by the pain-adaptation model.\nFirst the changes may be tuned to the individual problem probably through learning, as is suggested by the substantial variance between subjects.\nHowever, too few studies have attempted to discriminate between different diagnostic groups to allow more definitive conclusions.\nHowever, most of the studies reviewed have included only patients with chronic LBP.\nSecond, the changes appear tuned to the mechanical circumstances, or in other words to the task at hand.\nIn this study each LBP patient was found to show increased LES activation during at least one of the five experimental tasks, but when analyzing the data per task no differences between patients and controls were found.\nWe surmise that the changes observed due to pain in general are aimed at avoiding noxious tensile stresses in injured structures.\nOur interpretation is in line with the hypothesis on stability as a cause of LBP put forward by Panjabi [98,99,99a].\nIn rest postures, stability of the spine can be critical [19].\nIf the spine becomes unstable, excessive rotations of segments will occur and pain may be provoked [98,99].\nThe increased activation in rest postures, which reflects increased cocontraction and the changes in load sharing between lumbar and thoracic erector spinae may be aimed at enhancing stability.\nAbsence of flexion-relaxation is associated with limited segmental rotations [64].\nIt prevents excessive lengthening of muscle, ligaments, and posterior annulus by supporting the upper body against gravity through active muscle force, rather than with elastic forces in the aforementioned structures.\nThree reasons could be put forward, as to why back pain patients would need additional muscular stabilization of their spines:.\nLBP in many cases appears to be caused by injury to the ligaments or discs as a consequence of mechanical overloading [1,29,104].\nThese injuries and especially those of the intervertebral discs have a substantial effect on the mechanical behavior of the spine.\nIn relation to spinal stability the main effects are:.\na reduction of stiffness outside the neutral zone.\nan increase of the range of motion [62,63,105].\nAlthough it is difficult to verify the existence of such changes in living subjects, there is ample evidence that in many LBP patients the stiffness of affected spinal motion segments is decreased and the range of motion increased [36,69,112,114].\nThese changes will lead to a reduced spinal stability as evidenced by the fact that injured spinal motion segments buckle under lower compression forces as compared to intact specimens [136].\nThis buckling occurs at a very high velocity, which might preclude muscular corrections.\nConsequently, adaptations of muscular activation might be required to compensate for the reduced stiffness.\nThis could involve increased cocontraction [18,20,40] and adaptations in load sharing between extensor muscles [26].\nWith respect to the increased LES activation found in patients in full trunk flexion, it seems likely that this is explained by the need to limit the segmental range of motion [64,116].\nIt could limit the excursion of the vertebrae with respect to each other where the passive stiffness is insufficient to do so.\nMany studies have shown a reduced trunk muscle force in LBP patients as compared to healthy controls [72,90,126,127].\nThis is not only caused by a lack of maximal activation during the test, since wasting of the extensor muscle mass [44,45] and a loss of type II fibers [83] have been demonstrated.\nFurthermore, several studies have shown that LBP patients are characterized by a reduced endurance of the trunk extensor muscles.\nOn the basis of these findings it is likely that LBP patients will be less able to rapidly develop trunk muscle force.\nThis would limit their capacity to correct perturbations of trunk equilibrium and prevent spinal instability.\nInjuries of spinal ligaments are likely to cause a disturbance of the control of trunk equilibrium, since ligaments have been shown to have an important sensory function in feedback control of joint position [58,117].\nThis function probably also holds for injuries of the annulus fibrosus, which is richly supplied with mechanoreceptors [108,139].\nIn addition, reduced proprioception [15,37] and disturbances of postural control [80] have been found in back pain patients.\nThe same study demonstrated increased reaction times in LBP patients.\nImpaired postural control in back pain patients is associated with a reduced capacity to react to perturbations of trunk equilibrium [107].\nIn summary, all three subsystems that subserve spinal stability (the passive system, the control system and the muscular system [98]) appear to be affected in LBP, though not necessarily all at the same time.\nThe reduction in passive spinal stiffness would increase the risk of buckling under perturbations, whereas the changes in the control system and muscular system would impair the capacity to respond to perturbations.\nRecent studies have indeed confirmed that LBP patients respond less adequately to trunk perturbations [82,106].\nAlterations of trunk muscle recruitment patterns might be functional in LBP patients, since they would stiffen the trunk, thus precluding the probability of perturbations to which the patient could not adequately respond.\nThe above rationale might also account for the disappearance of anticipatory muscle activation and the consequent anticipatory postural adjustments in back pain patients preceding fast limb movements.\nHealthy subjects generally use specific anticipatory control to counteract ensuing perturbations of trunk equilibrium.\nFor instance when raising the arms forward, the back muscles are activated before the arm muscles to counteract the flexing torque on the trunk imposed by the arm movement [11,33,48,140].\nThis anticipatory activation is specific with respect to the magnitude and direction of the ensuing perturbation and antagonistic cocontractions appear to be absent.\nWhen moving the arms, specific anticipation is possible since the perturbation is entirely internal.\nHowever, it turns out that this can be generalized to situations in which the mechanical nature of the perturbation is to a lesser extent under the control of the subject.\nA good example of an everyday activity in which the mechanical nature of the perturbation is a priori unknown to the subject is the lifting of a load.\nThe mass and the center of mass position can only be known when the object has already been lifted [60,61].\nIt appears that also when lifting loads the trunk extensor musculature is activated in an anticipatory fashion, whereas no anticipatory activation of the antagonistic abdominal muscles is found [27].\nIn addition, this anticipatory activation was shown to be specific with respect to load magnitude [77] and center of mass position [27].\nWith an incorrect expectation of the ensuing perturbation, anticipatory actions will actually further disturb equilibrium [128].\nthe case in LBP patients [81,106], specific anticipation might impose a risk.\nFor this reason, patients might prepare by cocontracting muscles, as healthy subjects do when specific anticipation is impossible [71].\nFurthermore, anticipatory postural adjustments might be suppressed as was found in healthy subjects when the risk associated with balance loss was high [2] and in patient groups with problems in maintaining whole-body equilibrium [70].\nFinally it is conceivable that anticipatory adjustments are less relevant in patients, since the muscle activation patterns, such as elucidated in the present study, provide them with adequate stability to deal with ensuing perturbations [50a].\nIncreased coactivation could even account for the delayed and reduced responses after a perturbation [81,106], since prior activation of muscles reduces the amplitude of responses in these muscles to perturbations [122].\nBesides the positive effect of pain-related changes in muscular recruitment, some negative consequences are likely to occur.\nHyperactivity could cause pain in the muscles themselves, as proposed in the painspasmpain model.\nIn addition, increased cocontraction will increase the forces acting on the spine [28,40].\nHowever, the increased activation reported in the literature review is generally only small or moderate.\nMaybe more importantly, both cocontraction and selective derecruitment of muscles will limit functional abilities of patients.\nIt is possible that changes in recruitment of trunk musculature remain present after their functional significance has disappeared, when injured structures have recovered.\nIn chronic LBP, aspects of pain behavior in many cases appear to remain, whereas the physiological cause may no longer be present [34,132].\nThe fear of movement and re-injury, which characterizes many LBP patients [133], could underlie the remaining changes.\nThis assumption is supported by the relationship found between hyperactivity and other aspects of pain behavior [4] and by a study indicating that mental and hence mechanically irrelevant stressors may trigger the responses observed in muscle activation [35].\nNevertheless, caution should be exercised when rehabilitating LBP patients with the sole purpose of restoring a normal muscle recruitment pattern.\nThe abnormalities may represent compensation mechanisms to stabilize the spine.\nThe problem a clinician is facing then, is to differentiate between adaptive changes and unwanted residuals of former injury.\nFurther scientific research may provide the knowledge and methods to support clinical decision-making.\nThe changes observed are task-dependent, related to the individual problem and hence highly variable between and probably within individuals.\nWe propose that the alterations in trunk muscle recruitment in patients are functional in that they reduce the probability of noxious tissue stresses by limiting range of motion and providing stabilization of the spine.\nThis explanation should be tested in future experiments specifically designed to refute hypotheses derived from it.\nThe authors
