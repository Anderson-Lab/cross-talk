Structural abnormalities of several different anatomic structures can be responsible for lumbar spine pain. Symptoms are typically associated with pathological alterations in the intervertebral disc, facet joints, sacroiliac joints, vertebral endplates, vertebral bodies, and/or the paraspinal muscles, although the reverse—those pathological alterations regularly predict pain—is not necessarily true. Painful pathologic features typically include matrix damage, neovascularization, neoinnervation, and inflammation. Some of these features may be detectable using advanced imaging techniques

Four studies describe data for peripheral tissue dysfunction including disc (two RPF with little SOE confidence), vertebra (one RPF with little SOE confidence), and facets (one RPF with little SOE confidence) in relation to cLBP classification, pain severity and disability by questionnaire. Local inflammatory changes and loading of sensitized nociceptors are potential mechanisms.
