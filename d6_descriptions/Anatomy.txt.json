{"title": "Anatomy.txt", "contents": "Anatomy refers to the shape and size of lumbosacral and brain structures\nThe shape and size of spinal structures (vertebrae, facets, intervertebral discs, sacroiliac joints, muscles, ligaments, and pelvis) influence the capacity of the spine to support loads and maintain the biomechanical stability of the spine\nAlso important are brain areas involved in nociceptive processing (prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor areas, insula, basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem)\nAbnormalities of these spine and brain structures can increase risk\n\nThree studies compared transverse abdominis (TA) morphology/activity with clinical outcomes (one RFA with substantial non-association SOE confidence), and lumbar multifidi (LM) size/ultrasound characteristics with fat area, pain, motor control exercises, and EMG findings (two RPF with some SOE confidence)\n"}
