Sensory disturbances such as pain sensitivity are frequent features of chronic pain. Increased pain sensitivity in the primary pain area is considered a sign of peripheral sensitization, whereas pain sensitivity in areas anatomically remote from the primary pain area reflects a more central phenomenon.  People with heightened pain sensitivity report higher levels of pain/disability due to dysregulation of the central or peripheral nervous systems: cortical reorganization, neuronal sensitization/hyperexcitability. These are characterized by generalized hypersensitivity to both noxious and non-noxious stimuli (e.g., hyperalgesia, allodynia). fMRI studies demonstrate evidence of central pain amplification, altered nociceptive processing (nociplastic pain state) where a clear peripheral tissue injury may be completely absent. Quantitative measures of grey matter volume by MRI in cLBP patients demonstrate decreases in regions predominantly related to pain perception and integration. The assessment of sensory function using quantitative sensory testing (QST) can provide evidence of pain hypersensitivity.

Six studies report data related to central pain processing, including brain anatomy and functional changes (four RPF with little to some SOE confidence),  quantitative sensory testing (two RPF with little SOE confidence to substantial non-association RPF confidence) in relationship to cLBP classification (yes/no), pain severity, and disability by questionnaire. The authors discuss how maladaptive neuroplasticity can occur with chronic pain, which can associate with disrupted emotional and cognitive functioning that disrupts the complex interaction between peripheral input and central processing. Central sensitization can result.
