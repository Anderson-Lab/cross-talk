{"title": "Nociception_and_Neuropathic_Pain.txt", "contents": "Nociception is the neurochemical process by which specific nociceptors convey pain signals through peripheral neural pathways to the central nervous system\nNociceptive pain arises from the actual or pending damage to non-neural spine tissues due to activation of nociceptors\nActivation is typically due to a combination of mechanical and chemical sensitization (peripheral sensitization)\nNeuropathic pain is due to clinical problems with the involved nerves, such as nerve damage from compression, inflammation, or degeneration\n\nOne study showed that neuropathic pain (one RPF with little SOE confidence) is present in cLBP, and postulated that signs and symptoms of pseudoradiculopathy and radiculopathy reflect a disease continuum as opposed to difference disease entities\nWe did not identify any studies that reported on nociception\n"}
