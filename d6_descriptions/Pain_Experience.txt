Various instruments have been developed to evaluate the two key dimensions of the pain experience â€“ pain intensity (how much a person hurts) and pain affect (how much a person suffers). Other domains include pain frequency, and pain location. A key element of a pain experience is perception bias based on prior experience and expectancy. Cognitive processing of pain information modifies the pain experience. Cognitive evaluation of pain involves the appraisal of the pain sensation (as described in the Coping Theory) and the emotional reaction to the pain sensation. Threat appraisal contributes to pain chronicity. Cognitive fatigue results in concentration and memory problems, or difficulty making decisions.

Two studies reported data on pain experience associating  pain intensity (two RPF with little to some SOE confidence) and pain duration (three RPF with little to some SOE confidence) with lifting and carrying capacity tests, physical activity, sick leave, FABs, disability and functional status.
