Data.\nThere is growing consensus that psychosocial factors play a role in the development of LBP, although results are not consistent across studies.\nWithin a sample of 2556 middle-aged men and women from the Belstress study, baseline psychosocial factors were measured through self-administered questionnaires and related to prevalent cases of LBP after a mean time interval of 6.\n6 years through Cox regression analysis.\nAfter adjustment for individual and physical risks, including occasional back pain at baseline, the prevalence rate of LBP in men is significantly related to baseline low decision latitude and low social support at work, and nonsignificantly to high job strain, low wage and job satisfaction, feeling stressed at work, and feeling depressed.\nHigh job insecurity, feeling stressed at work, and feeling depressed nonsignificantly increase the relative risks for LBP in women.\nBased on the results of this study, psychosocial factors (both work and nonwork-related) constitute nonnegligible risks for the development of LBP.\nKey words: low back pain, psychosocial, work.\nLow back pain (LBP) is a considerable health problem in most Western countries.\nAccording to the Third European Survey on Working Conditions of 2000, 33% of European workers report backache, making it one of the most prevalent work-related health problems.\n1 Since most of the chronic low back disorders are believed to be multifactorial in origin, much research effort has been put in identifying different kinds of risk factors of LBP.\nThe occurrence and development of LBP is not only ascribed to individual characteristics but also to factors from the work environment.\nand physical work factors such as heavy lifting, repetitive motion, non-neutral body postures and vibration, are considered as established risks for back disorders.\nThere is growing consensus, however, that in addition to physical work load, psychosocial work characteristics play a role in LBP.\n47 The most common work-related psychosocial constructs in epidemiological research include factors like workload, limited control over work, job satisfaction, feeling stressed, and relationships at work.\nNumerous studies have emphasized the need to take into account both physical and psychosocial characteristics simultaneously in epidemiological studies on LBP.\n813 Nevertheless, several reviews have shown that results regarding the role of psychosocial factors on LBP are not consistent across studies.\n1417 There is general agreement that some association exists, but it is difficult to draw firm conclusions due to inconclusive evidence.\nThe inconsistency of study results is partly related to some crucial methodological issues, such as the study design, the assessment of exposure and outcome variables, and appropriate controlling for demographic and physical risk factors.\nThe aim of this study is to describe the impact of psychosocial factors, both workand nonwork-related, on the prevalence of LBP within a longitudinal study design.\nSecondly, we want to explore to what extent associations between psychosocial variables and LBP are confounded by individual and physical characteristics.\nThe association between psychosocial factors and LBP was assessed using data from the Belstress Study (Belstress) an epidemiological cohort study about job stress and health issues.\n18 A total of 2821 workers from 9 different companies or public administrations were involved in the longitudinal part of the study.\nData were gathered at baseline between 1995 and 1998 and a second time in 20022003 after a mean time interval of 6.\n5% was reached at the second phase.\nFor the longitudinal analyses described here, workers whose job title changed during the time interval according to the first digit of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (265 subjects) were excluded.\n19 This results in a study population of 2556 workers (1729 men and 827 women) aged 3559 years at the beginning of the study.\nThese workers are employed within 2 public administrations (55% of the sample), 6 private companies (34%), and one bank (11%).\nThe ethics committees of the University Hospital of Ghent and the Faculty of Medicine of the Free University of Brussels approved the Belstress study.\nFirst revision date: February 2, 2006.\nSecond revision date: March 15,

were measured through self-administered questionnaires.\nMost of the work-related factors were assessed using the standardized Job Content Questionnaire based on Karasek et als2022 job strain model.\nFive items measured psychological job demands.\nJob control or decision latitude is composed of 2 subscales: skill discretion (6 items) and decision authority (3 items).\nThe third dimension is social support at the workplace and also consists of 2 subscales: supervisor support (4 items) and coworker support (4 items).\nReliability and validity of these scales within the Belstress study project have been demonstrated.\nPerception of job insecurity was measured with 2 questions from the Job Content Questionnaire.\nIn addition, the general questionnaire contains 3 items concerning job and wage satisfaction, and feeling stressed at work.\nThree psychosocial factors outside the work environment were assessed through baseline questionnaires.\nThe strength of social networks refers to a score based on 3 items regarding the number and nature of contacts with friends and family.\n24 The concept of feelings of depression is composed of 11 items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale.\nOne question was added asking about the general satisfaction with private life.\nThe baseline questionnaire contains additional information on individual and physical characteristics that are treated as potential confounding variables.\nno) was assessed by one item from the Current Health Index (Do you once in a while suffer from back pain?).\nBody mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by the square of the height (m).\n27 Participants were classified as having LBP when they had had LBP of any kind for a total of 8 days or more during the previous 12 months.\nHigh job strain refers to the combination of high job demands (values above the median) and low decision latitude (values below the median).\nLow satisfaction with the job, wage, and private life refers to being (very) dissatisfied as opposed to neutral or (very) satisfied.\nParticipants were classified as stressed at work when they felt moderately or very stressed.\nThe upper quartile of the depression scale with scores of 18 or higher is considered to suffer from depressive feelings.\nLow education was defined as primary school level only and high education as high school or university.\nweek, are classified as physically active.\nHigh physical job demands are identified when respondents (fully) agree with the questions regarding physical effort, lifting heavy loads, rapid physical activity, awkward body positions, and awkward arm positions at work.\nA BMI between 25 and 29 kg/m2 is classified as overweight and a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more as obesity.\nChi-square tests were carried out to explore whether cases with LBP differ from noncases in individual and physical characteristics at baseline.\nCox regression analyses were conducted in order to assess the impact of baseline psychosocial factors on LBP.\nSubsequently, it was tested to what extent these associations are confounded by other risk factors through multivariate analyses.\nIndividual and physical factors were included in the full model, regardless of the results of their univariate associations with the outcome variable.\n29 Adjustments were made for individual and sociodemographic variables (age, BMI, educational level, sector of employment, occasional back pain, smoking status, and living situation) in the first step, and, additionally, for physical factors (physical activity, physical effort, lifting heavy loads, rapid physical activity, awkward body positions, and awkward arm positions at work) in the next step.\nAnalyses were performed separately for men and women.\nThe mean age of the sample at baseline was 43.\n6 years (standard deviation 5.\nThe population contains 441 executives (17%), 1190 white-collar workers (47%), and 916 blue-collar workers (36%).\nWithin the sample of 2556 workers, 1079 cases (42.\n2%) with LBP of any kind were identified at the second study phase.\nThis prevalence rate of LBP is significantly higher in women as compared to men: 413 out of 827 women (49.\n9%) and 666 out of 1729 men (38.\nThe prevalence of cases with LBP is higher in participants with a lower educational level, workers from the public sector, those with occasional back pain at baseline, smokers, and workers with high physical job demands.\nWomen aged 45 years or more have more LBP than those who are younger.\nLBP is more frequent in men with overweight and obesity.\nThe relative risk for LBP in men is significantly increased with 37% by baseline low decision latitude and with approximately one fifth by baseline high job strain, low social support at work, low wage satisfaction, and feeling stressed at work.\nWithin the female population, nonsignificant associations are found with low decision latitude, high job insecurity, and feeling stressed at work.\nConcerning psychosocial factors outside the work environment, LBP relates primarily to feelings of depression at baseline, with an increase in the relative.\nrisk of 34% in men and 30% in women.\nIn men, low satisfaction with private life also slightly increased the relative risk for LBP.\nWithin this study design, we could not exclude workers with LBP at baseline because the Nordic Questionnaire was not available.\nwithin the subgroup of participants without occasional back pain at baseline show associations between crude relative risks for LBP in men with low decision latitude (relative risk 1.\n09), high job strain (relative risk 1.\n91), low social support (relative risk 1.\n08), low job satisfaction (relative risk 1.\n78), low wage satisfaction (relative risk 1.\n38), feeling stressed at work (relative risk 1.\n03), while crude relative risks for LBP in women are associated with high job insecurity (relative risk 1.\nAfter adjustment for individual, sociodemographic, and physical risks, the relative risk for LBP in men is significantly increased by baseline low decision latitude (relative risk 1.\n20) and low social support at work (relative risk 1.\nIn men, a borderline significant association is found with feeling stressed at work, and nonsignificant associations with high job strain, low job and wage satisfaction, and feeling depressed.\nThe relative risk for LBP in women is borderline significantly increased by feeling depressed, and nonsignificantly by high job insecurity and feeling stressed at work.\nAge 45 y 343

between psychosocial factors and physical job demands in relation to LBP.\nControlling for physical work factors does not reduce the strength of the associations between psychosocial factors and LBP extensively.\nThe aim of this longitudinal study was to explore the impact of psychosocial risk factors on LBP.\nWithin a sample of 2556 middle-aged men and women, psychosocial factors at baseline were related to the prevalence of cases with LBP after a mean time interval of 6.\nof psychosocial factors in the etiology of LBP, some recent reviews have emphasized the uncertainty of the exact relationship due to the lack of consistency in study results.\nBased on the results of this study, psychosocial factors constitute nonnegligible risks for LBP.\nMoreover, most associations are independent from occasional back pain at baseline, as well as from other individual and physical risk factors.\nAmong the psychosocial work characteristics, one of the significant and independent predictors of LBP in men is baseline low social support at work.\nSeveral studies reported that the most consistent and pronounced associations with back pain were situated in the field of worksite social support.\n8,9,3033 In reviewing prospective studies on psychosocial work characteristics and LBP, Hoogendoorn et al6 found strong evidence for low social support in the workplace as a risk factor.\nAfter adjustments were made for individual and physical factors, the prevalence of LBP in men was also significantly related with low decision latitude, and nonsignificantly.\n21) Low

heterogeneity exists in the literature regarding the role of low job control and low job satisfaction in LBP.\nAlthough some reviews find support for a positive association between these factors and LBP,6,7,15 others contradict this.\n14,17 It has been suggested that the influence of psychosocial factors on LBP may not be solely related to work itself but also to the broader nonwork-related context; therefore, it is also important to take into account work-related perceptions such as satisfaction with work status and income and job stress in trying to understand the development of LBP.\n13,34,35 In their review on psychosocial work factors and LBP, Davis and Heaney16 suggested that the most consistent associations are not found with psychosocial work characteristics themselves but with employee responses or reactions to their work conditions.\nIn our longitudinal study, the prevalence of LBP is both related to psychosocial work characteristics themselves (low decision latitude and low social support in men and high job insecurity in women), as to employee reactions to work conditions (low job and wage satisfaction in men and feeling stressed at work in men and women).\nWhen assessing associations between psychosocial factors and LBP, the emphasis in most studies is on characteristics related solely to the work environment.\nHowever, psychosocial factors outside the work environment may also play an important role in the development of LBP.\nConditions in leisure time such as satisfaction with social contacts can exert a long-term influence on LBP.\nConditions of psychological or emotional distress, including depressive feelings and anxiety, have also been related to musculoskeletal disorders and LBP.\n37,38 In this study, associations were found between feeling depressed and the prevalence of LBP.\nSome notable gender differences were found in our study.\nOverall, psychosocial work factors proved to be important with respect to LBP, but to a lesser extent in women as compared to men.\nSimilar results were found in various other studies.\n3942 Hooftman et al43 recently reviewed 14 studies regarding gender differences in the effect of risk factors on back complaints.\nWith respect to the effect of job demands, job control, and job satisfaction, the evidence for gender differences is inconclusive due to inconsistent results.\nNo evidence was found of a gender difference in the impact of social support at the workplace, which is not in line with the results of this study.\nAn important problem in many studies exploring the impact of psychosocial factors on LBP is the lack of proper adjustment for other risk factors, especially physical or biomechanical workload.\n6,16 In our study, however, relationships between psychosocial factors and future LBP are not essentially confounded by individual or physical variables.\nThis was also found in a Dutch prospective cohort study in 861 workers.\nThe assessment of LBP in this study was not done through clinical examination but with a self-report mea-.\nsure, which inevitably includes some amount of subjectivity.\nNevertheless, random error in the operationalization of LBP was minimized because of the use of the validated and standardized Nordic questionnaire for musculoskeletal symptoms.\n27 LBP in this study was identified as having had LBP for a total of 8 days or more during the previous 12 months, which is very common.\nThe same analyses were conducted with a more stringent definition: having had LBP for a total of 30 days or more during the previous 12 months (prevalent in 21.\nThis led to similar results, although some of the associations did not reach statistical significance.\nHowever, information was available regarding occasional back pain at baseline.\nWith the inclusion of this variable in multivariate analyses, it is fair to assume that the largest part of LBP at baseline is controlled for.\nMoreover, additional analyses after exclusion of all participants with occasional back pain at baseline roughly engendered similar results regarding psychosocial factors and LBP.\nA notable limitation of this study is that no information is available on possible changes in exposure to psychosocial factors between baseline and the assessment of LBP at the second study phase.\nParticipants whose job title changed during the time interval were excluded.\nThis was done in order to rule out changes in psychosocial work factors due to objective changes in the work environment.\nIn addition, measuring job characteristics at only one point in time increases the risk of misclassification due to inaccuracy in assessment.\n44 Consequently, the relationships found in our study are probably underestimations or at least conservative estimates of the truly existing associations between psychosocial factors and the development of LBP.\nThe presence of a selection bias in the population should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results.\nFor the longitudinal results of this study, only those workers who were involved in both phases of the data collection were included.\nWithin the 9 participating companies, a total of 8783 employees had participated in the first study phase.\nAt the second study phase, more than half of this original population was no longer eligible due to retirement, resignation, dismissal, or decease.\nIt concerns primarily workers from lower educational levels, lower occupations, and older age groups.\nWithin 3 companies from the secondary or manufacturing sector, major reorganizations and restructuring measures had been carried out, as a result of which 73% of the original study sample was no longer at work there after the follow-up period.\nhad also taken place within 4 companies from the service sector; 47% of the population was no longer eligible for participation.\nWithin 2 public administrations, 33% was no longer eligible, which was mostly due to natural retirements.\nObviously, this results in a healthy worker effect within our population.\nAt baseline, the drop-out population perceived significantly less job control.\nIn addition, severe LBP at baseline might also be related to the drop-out.\nConsequently, associations between psychosocial factors and LBP in this study are most likely underestimated.\nOur results provide additional support to the findings linking LBP to psychosocial risk factors.\nBoth work and nonwork-related psychosocial factors are associated with having LBP after 6.\n6 years on average within a sample of 2556 middle-aged men and women who remained in the same job.\nMoreover, the associations are independent from some important individual and physical risk factors, including occasional back pain at baseline.\nBased on the results of this study, both work and nonwork-related psychosocial factors constitute nonnegligible risks for LBP.\nThe associations between psychosocial factors and LBP are independent from some important individual and physical risk factors, including occasional back pain at baseline.\nIn women, psychosocial work factors were less important with
