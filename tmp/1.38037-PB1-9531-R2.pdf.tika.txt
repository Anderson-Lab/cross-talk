Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal problem globally. Updating the 
prevalence and burden of LBP is important for researchers and policy makers. This paper presents, compares 
and contextualizes the global prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of LBP by age, sex and 
region, from 1990 to 2017.
Methods: Data were extracted from the GBD (the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study) 2017 Study. Age, sex and region-specific analyses were conducted to estimate the global prevalence 
and YLDs of LBP, with the uncertainty intervals (UIs). 
Results: The age-standardized point prevalence of LBP was 8.20% (95% UI: 7.31–9.10%) in 1990 
and decreased slightly to 7.50% (95% UI: 6.75–8.27%) in 2017. The prevalent numbers of people with 
LBP at any one point in time in 1990 was 377.5 million, and this increased to 577.0 million in 2017. Age-
standardized prevalence of LBP was higher in females than males. LBP prevalence increased with age, and 
peaked around the ages of 80 to 89 years, and then decreased slightly. Global YLDs were 42.5 million (95% 
UI: 30.2 million–57.2 million) in 1990 and increased by 52.7% to 64.9 million (95% UI: 46.5 million–87.4 
million) in 2017. YLDs were also higher in females than males and increased initially with age; they peaked 
at 35–39 years of age in 1990, before decreasing, whereas in 2017, they peaked at 45–49 years of age, before 
decreasing. Western Europe had the highest number of LBP YLDs.
Conclusions: Globally, LBP is the leading global cause of YLDs. Greater attention is urgently needed to 
mitigate this increasing burden and the impact it is having on health and social systems.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is the most common musculoskeletal 
problem globally (1-4). It is the leading cause of activity 
limitation and absenteeism from work (5-7), and results 
in a huge medical burden and economic cost (2,8). It 
is consequently one of the major global public health 
problems (9-11).

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study is updated 
every one to two years (6,12-15). LBP is included as one 
of the musculoskeletal conditions in GBD study—the last 
article describing the global burden of LBP in detail was 
based upon the GBD 2010 (10) analysis. However, since 
then, there have been a number of methodological changes 
made and updated data (6). These include: an updated 
DisMod-MR tool; construction of a Socio-Demographic 
Index (SDI); further research to establish disability weights 
(DWs); and adjustment for comorbidity (6). Therefore, 
it is important to present these changes and highlight the 
resulting update on the prevalence and global burden of 
LBP.

Methods

All of the data analysed and presented in this article were 
obtained from the updated GBD 2017 (the Global Burden 
of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study) (http://www.
healthdata.org/gbd/data). The GBD 2017 data were 
derived from the GBD repository of population health 
data, including World Health Surveys and National Health 
Surveys, literature reviews, and claims data. Literature 
review for LBP was conducted in October 2017. The 
electronic databases of Ovid Medline, EMBase, and 
CINAHL were searched and eight studies were included. In 
addition, USA claims data for 2000, 2010, 2012, and 2014 
by state, and Taiwan claims data from 2016 were included. 

In brief, Bayesian meta-regressions by DisMod-MR 
2.1 were used to synthesize sparse and heterogeneous, 
epidemiological data to estimate the point prevalence and 
YLD outcomes. In GBD 2010, DisMod-MR 1.0 was used to 
pool all data by world region. This was updated to DisMod-
MR 2.0 in GBD 2013, which increased the computational 
speed allowing consistent computations between all disease 
parameters at the country level. DisMod-MR 2.1 was used 
in GBD 2016 and 2017, and enables estimates down to the 
sub-national level. Results were stratified by five-year age 
groups from birth up to 95+. The detailed methods of the 
systematic analysis for GBD 2017 by the IHME (Institute 

for Health Metrics and Evaluation) have been published 
elsewhere (6).

LBP was defined as pain that lasts for at least one day 
(with/without pain referred into one or both lower limbs) in 
the area on the posterior aspect of the body from the lower 
margin of the 12th ribs to the lower gluteal folds (10,16,17). 

DWs represent the magnitude of health loss associated 
with BP. DWs were measured on a scale from zero to 
one, with zero representing a state of full health, and one 
representing a state equivalent to death. The DWs used in 
GBD 2010 were based on face to face surveys conducted in 
five countries as well as an internet survey (10). The DWs 
used in GBD 2017 have been described previously (18), and 
also included data from the European Disability Weights 
Measurement Study that took place in Hungary, Italy, the 
Netherlands and Sweden.

A total of six sequelae were used to represent the 
different levels of LBP severity: (I) most severe BP with leg 
pain (DW: 0.384, 95% CI: 0.256–0.518); (II) most severe 
BP without leg pain (DW: 0.372, 95% CI: 0.250–0.506); 
(III) severe BP with leg pain (DW: 0.325, 95% CI: 0.219–
0.446); (IV) severe BP without leg pain (DW: 0.272, 95% 
CI: 0.182–0.373); (V) moderate BP with/without leg pain 
(DW: 0.054, 95% CI: 0.035–0.079); and (VI) mild BP with/
without leg pain (DW: 0.020, 95% CI: 0.011–0.035).

There is no mortality from LBP, therefore, the YLDs 
and DALYs (Disability-adjusted life years) values are the 
same. In this paper, we have only used the term YLDs. The 
unadjusted YLDs of each sequela were calculated using the 
formula: 

YLDsequela = Prevalencesequela × DWsequela (17). 
The SDI was originally constructed in GBD 2015; it is a 

composite indicator of development status correlated with 
health outcomes. Briefly, it is the geometric mean of 0 to 1 
indices of total fertility rate under the age of 25 (TFU25), 
mean education for those aged 15 and older (EDU15+), and 
lag-distributed income (LDI) per capita.

A comorbidity correction involving a micro-simulation 
performed for each age-sex-location-year, was used to 
calculate the comorbidity-adjusted YLDs at the final stage. 
The co-occurrence of different diseases was estimated by 
simulating 40,000 individuals in each age-sex-location-
year combination based on disease prevalence. A flow chart 
describing the process for estimating the YLDs is shown in 
Figure 1.

Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated using a 
propagating technique also described elsewhere (15,19,20). 
Briefly, the distribution of every computed step was stored

in 1,000 draws; the final estimate is the mean estimate 
across all 1,000 draws, and the 95% UI is the 25th and 
975th ranked values.

Results

Prevalence

The age-standardized point prevalence of LBP in the 21 
world regions by gender at 1990 and 2017 is summarized in 
Table 1.

Globally, the age-standardized point prevalence of 
LBP was 8.20% (95% UI: 7.31–9.10%) in 1990, and 
this decreased to 7.50% (95% UI: 6.75–8.27%) in 2017. 
Prevalence was higher in females than males. For females, 
this was 8.86% (95% UI: 7.90–9.82%) in 1990 and 
8.01% (95% UI: 7.22–8.84%) in 2017, whereas for males, 
prevalence was 7.47% (95% UI: 6.67–8.31%) in 1990 and 
6.94% (95% UI: 6.24–7.67%) in 2017 (Figure 2A). The 
estimated prevalent numbers of people with LBP was  
377.5 million in 1990, and this increased to 577.0 million in 
2017, due to the considerable increased population globally 

from 1990 to 2017 (Figure 2B).
LBP prevalence increased with age, peaking around the 

ages 80 to 89 years old, and then slightly decreased. This 
pattern was observed in both females and males, in 1990 
and 2017 (Figure 3A,B). 

In 2017, the highest LBP prevalence was Southern 
Latin America (13.47%), followed by high-income Asia 
Pacific (13.16%), while the lowest was East Asia (3.92%), 
followed by Central Latin America (5.62%). The highest 
prevalent number of people with LBP was South Asia  
(96.3 million), followed by East Asia (67.7 million), while the 
lowest prevalent number of people with LBP was Oceania  
(0.7 million), followed by Caribbean (2.7 million).

Years lived with disability (YLDs)

LBP was the leading cause of YLDs for both 1990 and 2017 
out of the all conditions studied in GBD 2017. In both time 
points, LBP was the leading cause of YLDs in 13 out of the 
21 world regions (Table 2).

The global YLDs for LBP were 42.5 million (95% UI:

then, the individual SF-12 summary scores were mapped to an equivalent disability weight (DW); Nonfatal database: low back pain is one 
type of nonfatal disease, therefore, the data are input into the GBD nonfatal database; The “year” under the prevalence by location/year/

26.2 million, respectively) and 2017 (35.5 million, 95% UI: 
25.4 million–47.7 million, compared to 29.5 million, 95% UI: 
21.0 million–40.0 million, respectively) (Table 2). The age-
standardized YLD rate (per 100,000 population) decreased 
slightly from 892 (95% UI: 637–1,195) in 1990 to 810 (95% 
UI: 582–1,089) in 2017, although this was not statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level. The age-standardized YLD rate 
was also higher in females than males (Table 2).

Total YLDs for LBP also increased initially with age; 
they peaked at 35–39 years of age in 1990, before decreasing 
(Figure 4A), whereas in 2017, they peaked at 45–49 years of 
age, before decreasing (Figure 4B). Both females and males 

had similar trends.
In 2017, the region with the highest number of YLDs 

was South Asia (10.8 million, 95% UI: 7.7 million–14.7 
million), followed by East Asia (7.7 million, 95% UI: 5.53 
million–10.4 million). The region with the lowest number 
of YLDs was Oceania (73,589, 95% UI: 52,501–100,281), 
followed by the Caribbean (303,867, 95% UI: 219,393–
408,488). The region with the highest age-standardized 
YLD rate (per 100,000 persons) was Southern Latin 
America [1,404], followed by high-income Asia Pacific 
[1,361]. The region with the lowest age-standardized YLDs 
rate was East Asia [419], followed by Central Latin America 
[604].

The prevalence (in %) of LBP had decreased between 1990 
and 2017, whereas the prevalent number of people with 
LBP and the number of YLDs had increased substantially. 
LBP remains the leading global cause of YLDs in 2017. It 
should be noted that with each GBD study iteration, new 
data are being added to the models that derive the estimates 
over time. This consequently alters and strengthens the 
model outputs—as a result, and for example, prevalence 
estimates from GBD 2010 may differ from those from GBD 
2017. Other factors that may influence prevalence changes 
between iterations are changes to the DWs, the DisMod-
MR tool, construction of the SDI, and adjustments for 
comorbidity.

The gender disparity of LBP prevalence was different 
in GBD 2017 compared to GBD 2010 (10). In GBD 
2010, prevalence was reportedly higher in males (10.1%) 
compared to females (8.1%); however, prevalence was 
higher in females in GBD 2017. This difference between 
GBD 2010 and GBD 2017 is mainly attributed to the 
improved data coverage and methods in GBD 2017 rather 
than any real changes over this period. Other studies 
have reported a similar gender trend (21-24). Possible 
explanations for this are likely to be complex and may 
include biological, psychological and sociocultural factors 
(22,25,26). However, another interesting finding is that 
males in Central, Eastern, Western and Southern Sub-
Saharan Africa had a higher prevalence than females—
further research is needed to better understand this.

The prevalence trends by age observed in GBD 2017 
were similar to GBD 2010 (10). Prevalence was high in all 
age groups from 18 years onwards, and peaked at around 
80–89 years old (Figure 3). There are many factors that 
may increase the prevalence of LBP with age. Aging is 
associated with pain, which may restrict social and physical 
function (27); consequently, this restriction may result 
in further deterioration of the musculoskeletal system 
and further pain. Degeneration of the lumbar spine as a 
potential contributor to LBP continues to be a subject of 
debate (28-32). 

There was a slight decrease in the point prevalence (%) 
of LBP from 1990 to 2017, although this was not significant 
at the 0.05 level. The number of prevalent cases of LBP 
and number of YLDs has increased dramatically in this 
period, although, again, this was not significant at the 0.05 
level. If these are real increases, they are likely to be mainly 
driven by aging and increasing population numbers (19) 
—having said this, the influence of this will vary from 
region to region, and there may also be other contributing 

factors such as obesity, increased motorization (1,4), and 
willingness to report pain. Of note, the point prevalence 
and age-standardized YLDs rate (per 100,000 persons) in 
Southern Latin America, high-income Asia Pacific, Andean 
Latin America, Australasia and Western Sub-Saharan Africa 
have all increased suggesting that factors beyond aging and 
population increase may be at play. 

The age trend for YLDs was different to that of 
prevalence. YLDs peaked in the middle-aged population, 
and thus the working-age population is most greatly 
affected by the burden of LBP. Figure 4 shows YLDs peaked 
around the ages 35 to 39 years old in 1990. However, 
consistent with the aging population and increasing global 
life expectancy, this peak was delayed to 45 to 49 years old 
in 2017 (19).

Strengths and limitations

The updated GBD 2017 has been improved compared 
to GBD 2010. More up-to-date data were included from 
World Health Surveys and National Health Surveys, 
the European Disability Weights Measurement Study, 
additional systematic reviews, and claims data from the 
USA Taiwan. Methodological changes included (I) updating 
the DisMod-MR tool, (II) having greater granularity in 
reporting of results for the oldest age groups (80–84, 85–89, 
90–94 and 95+ years), (III) construction of a SDI, and 
(IV) adjustment for comorbidity. These changes increase 
confidence in the accuracy of results. 

Despite some improvements since GBD 2010, sufficient 
population-based prevalence and burden estimates on 
LBP are still lacking from many regions and countries. 
Consequently, burden estimates were heavily reliant 
on models. While these models have been improved, it 
should be noted that they are models rather than original 
data. Further, of the studies that were included in the 
analysis, substantial heterogeneity remains between the 
case definitions used. This has made it difficult to compare 
the data across countries and over time. Additionally, it is 
difficult to determine with confidence the impact of changes 
to LBP policy and practice. Hence, this is the key limitation 
in estimating and understanding the global burden of LBP. 
Standardisation of data collection would be an important first 
step. The Global Alliance for Musculoskeletal (MSK) Health 
and the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study MSK Expert 
Group have developed a standardized survey questionnaire 
for measuring the population prevalence of LBP and other 
MSK conditions (24). The tool can be found online at: http://

bjdonline.org/msk-survey-module/. The case definitions 
are aligned to those of the GBD. The intention for the 
questionnaire is for it to be integrated within pre-existing and 
planned surveys such as National Health Surveys, and not 
being used as a stand-alone tool. This will help to minimize 
the burden from having to conduct multiple surveys in the 
local communities, and, subsequently, will save the required 
resources. It also encourages LBP and other musculoskeletal 
disorders to be viewed as being integrated within broader 
health initiatives rather than being seen as a separate issue. 
It is hoped this publicly-available module will be widely 
adopted to increase the availability of comparable data on 
LBP and other MSKs (24). 

The DWs used also have some limitations. The DWs 
were based on surveys that were conducted in a limited 
number of countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Peru, Tanzania, 
the USA, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden) 
prior to 2013 as well as a global web-based survey (18).  
The surveys rely on perceptions of respondents to often 
brief descriptions of a complex health problem. More recent 
surveys in a greater number of countries will increase the 
generalizability of the DWs.

Implications for policy and practice

From 1990 to 2017, LBP continued to be the leading 
cause of YLDs globally. Many countries and health-related 
organizations continue to prioritize communicate diseases 
over non-communicable diseases such as LBP. The Lancet 
Low Back Pain Series recently made a call for action 
on the management of LBP burden from governments, 
policy makers and the broader society (8,9,33). However, 
there continues to be a gap between evidence for effective 
management of LBP and current practice and policy, as 
outlined in the recent Lancet Series (8,9,33). Greater 
attention is needed to bridge this gap. A biopsychosocial 
framework could be used to guide the management 
including education, self-management, resumption of usual 
activities and exercise, and psychological measures for 
those with persistent symptoms. Management guidelines 
for different stages of BP and for different contexts 
should also be recommended. The recent Lancet Series 
documented high level of the inappropriate investigations 
and treatments that are contributing to the LBP burden for 
both individuals and society. Key recommended principles 
for LBP would be to reduce unnecessary imaging and 
treatment, support people to be active and stay at work, and 
to only use medication, imaging, and surgery prudently (33). 

For high-risk cases, prevention and early intervention could 
be considered. Linton et al. reported a stepped, stratified, 
and matched care approach might reduce wastage of clinical 
time and resources (34).

Hartvigsen et al. (8) concluded that the cost and disability 
from LBP vary substantially between countries, and would 
increase in the coming decades. Many of the risk factors 
(such as obesity, increased motorization and work-related 
issues) associated with LBP identified in those high-
income countries are also present in developing countries 
(1,4,35,36). High-income countries are likely to have better 
developed health systems to manage this increasing burden. 
For these low-income and middle-income countries, 
health systems are most likely not as well developed, and, 
therefore, will face greater challenges in managing the 
impact of the growing LBP burden.

Given that many of the risk factors for LBP are shared 
by other non-communicable diseases, it is imperative that 
integrated, collaborative approaches are established and 
built upon to ensure affordable solutions to the growing 
burden of LBP (37), especially, in low- and middle-income 
countries (38). Greater efforts are urgently needed to 
expand the amount of comparable data on the prevalence 
of LBP at national and sub-national levels. Future 
investigation should also include the effectiveness, cost-
effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic strategies. 

Conclusions

The global prevalence and YLD rates from LBP decreased 
slightly from the 1990 to 2017, but the number of LBP 
sufferers and YLDs increased substantially. Prevalence 
and YLDs were higher in females than males. Prevalence 
increased with age, and YLDs peaked at around 35 to 49 
years of age. Globally, LBP remains the leading global cause 
of YLDs, yet it continues to be inadequately recognized as 
a disease burden in the population with the major disparity 
continuing between the level of burden, and the policy, 
research and health services response. This will continue 
to be an urgent need for governments and other donors 
(33,38).
