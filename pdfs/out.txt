Study Design. An epidemiological cohort study.
Objective. To describe the impact of psychosocial fac-
tors, both work and nonwork-related, on the prevalence
of low back pain (LBP) after 6.6 years on average.
Summary of Background Data. There is growing con-
sensus that psychosocial factors play a role in the devel-
opment of LBP, although results are not consistent across
studies.
Methods. Within a sample of 2556 middle-aged men
and women from the Belstress study, baseline psychos-
ocial factors were measured through self-administered
questionnaires and related to prevalent cases of LBP after
a mean time interval of 6.6 years through Cox regression
analysis.
Results. After adjustment for individual and physical
risks, including occasional back pain at baseline, the prev-
alence rate of LBP in men is significantly related to base-
line low decision latitude and low social support at work,
and nonsignificantly to high job strain, low wage and job
satisfaction, feeling stressed at work, and feeling de-
pressed. High job insecurity, feeling stressed at work, and
feeling depressed nonsignificantly increase the relative
risks for LBP in women.
Conclusions. Based on the results of this study, psy-
chosocial factors (both work and nonwork-related) consti-
tute nonnegligible risks for the development of LBP.

Low back pain (LBP) is a considerable health problem in
most Western countries. According to the Third Euro-
pean Survey on Working Conditions of 2000, 33% of
European workers report backache, making it one of the
most prevalent work-related health problems.1 Since
most of the chronic low back disorders are believed to be
multifactorial in origin, much research effort has been
put in identifying different kinds of risk factors of LBP.
The occurrence and development of LBP is not only as-
cribed to individual characteristics but also to factors
from the work environment.2,3 Several biomechanical

and physical work factors such as heavy lifting, repetitive
motion, non-neutral body postures and vibration, are
considered as established risks for back disorders.
There is growing consensus, however, that in addition
to physical work load, psychosocial work characteristics
play a role in LBP.4–7 The most common work-related
psychosocial constructs in epidemiological research in-
clude factors like workload, limited control over work,
job satisfaction, feeling stressed, and relationships at
work. Numerous studies have emphasized the need to
take into account both physical and psychosocial char-
acteristics simultaneously in epidemiological studies on
LBP.8–13 Nevertheless, several reviews have shown that
results regarding the role of psychosocial factors on LBP
are not consistent across studies.14–17 There is general
agreement that some association exists, but it is difficult
to draw firm conclusions due to inconclusive evidence.
The inconsistency of study results is partly related to
some crucial methodological issues, such as the study
design, the assessment of exposure and outcome vari-
ables, and appropriate controlling for demographic and
physical risk factors.16

The aim of this study is to describe the impact of
psychosocial factors, both work- and nonwork-related,
on the prevalence of LBP within a longitudinal study
design. Secondly, we want to explore to what extent
associations between psychosocial variables and LBP are
confounded by individual and physical characteristics.

Materials and Methods

Study Population. The association between psychosocial fac-
tors and LBP was assessed using data from the Belstress Study
(Belstress) an epidemiological cohort study about job stress and
health issues.18 A total of 2821 workers from 9 different com-
panies or public administrations were involved in the longitu-
dinal part of the study. Data were gathered at baseline between
1995 and 1998 and a second time in 2002–2003 after a mean
time interval of 6.6 years. A participation rate of 68.5% was
reached at the second phase. For the longitudinal analyses de-
scribed here, workers whose job title changed during the time
interval according to the first digit of the International Stan-
dard Classification of Occupations (265 subjects) were ex-
cluded.19 This results in a study population of 2556 workers
(1729 men and 827 women) aged 35–59 years at the beginning
of the study. These workers are employed within 2 public ad-
ministrations (55% of the sample), 6 private companies (34%),
and one bank (11%).
The ethics committees of the University Hospital of Ghent
and the Faculty of Medicine of the Free University of Brussels
approved the Belstress study.

Data Collection. Psychosocial factors at baseline were mea-
sured through self-administered questionnaires. Most of the
work-related factors were assessed using the standardized Job
Content Questionnaire based on Karasek et al’s20–22 job strain
model. Five items measured psychological job demands. Job
control or decision latitude is composed of 2 subscales: “skill
discretion” (6 items) and “decision authority” (3 items). The
third dimension is social support at the workplace and also
consists of 2 subscales: “supervisor support” (4 items) and
“coworker support” (4 items). Reliability and validity of these
scales within the Belstress study project have been demonstrated.23

Perception of job insecurity was measured with 2 questions
from the Job Content Questionnaire. In addition, the general
questionnaire contains 3 items concerning job and wage satis-
faction, and feeling stressed at work.
Three psychosocial factors outside the work environment
were assessed through baseline questionnaires. The strength of
social networks refers to a score based on 3 items regarding the
number and nature of contacts with friends and family.24 The
concept of feelings of depression is composed of 11 items from
the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale.25

One question was added asking about the general satisfaction
with private life.
The baseline questionnaire contains additional information
on individual and physical characteristics that are treated as
potential confounding variables. Data were gathered about
age, educational level (low, medium, or high), living situation
(alone or with partner), smoking status (current smokers vs.
others), sector of employment (secondary, tertiary, or public
sector), and physical activity outside work. Occasional back
pain (yes vs. no) was assessed by one item from the “Current
Health Index” (“Do you once in a while suffer from back
pain?”).26 Five Job Content Questionnaire items regarding
physical demands of the job were included: physical effort,
lifting heavy loads, rapid physical activity, awkward body po-
sitions, and awkward arm positions.22 Trained observers med-
ically examined participants at baseline. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by the square
of the height (m).
At the second data collection after a mean time interval of
6.6 years, prevalent cases of LBP were identified using the stan-
dardized Nordic questionnaire.27 Participants were classified
as having LBP when they had had LBP of any kind for a total of
8 days or more during the previous 12 months.

Statistics. All psychosocial risk factors were dichotomized.
This categorization was based on the median values of this
population for the scales of job demands (12), decision latitude
(27), social support at work (23), and job insecurity (3). High
job strain refers to the combination of high job demands (val-
ues above the median) and low decision latitude (values below
the median). Low satisfaction with the job, wage, and private
life refers to being (very) dissatisfied as opposed to neutral or
(very) satisfied. Participants were classified as stressed at work
when they felt moderately or very stressed. A strong social net-
work is attributed when participants have regular contacts (at
least once a month) with at least 5 close friends or family mem-
bers. The upper quartile of the depression scale with scores of 18
or higher is considered to suffer from depressive feelings.
Low education was defined as primary school level only and
high education as high school or university. Persons who en-
gage in heavy physical activity (resulting in sweating and ele-
vated pulse rate) during 20 minutes or more, at least once a

week, are classified as physically active. High physical job de-
mands are identified when respondents (fully) agree with the
questions regarding physical effort, lifting heavy loads, rapid
physical activity, awkward body positions, and awkward arm
positions at work. A BMI between 25 and 29 kg/m2 is classified
as overweight and a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more as obesity.28

Chi-square tests were carried out to explore whether cases
with LBP differ from noncases in individual and physical char-
acteristics at baseline. Cox regression analyses were conducted
in order to assess the impact of baseline psychosocial factors on
LBP. Subsequently, it was tested to what extent these associa-
tions are confounded by other risk factors through multivariate
analyses. Individual and physical factors were included in the
full model, regardless of the results of their univariate associa-
tions with the outcome variable.29 Adjustments were made for
individual and sociodemographic variables (age, BMI, educa-
tional level, sector of employment, occasional back pain, smok-
ing status, and living situation) in the first step, and, addition-
ally, for physical factors (physical activity, physical effort,
lifting heavy loads, rapid physical activity, awkward body po-
sitions, and awkward arm positions at work) in the next step.
Analyses were performed separately for men and women.
All analyses were conducted using SPSS 12.0 software (SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL).

Results

The mean age of the sample at baseline was 43.6 years
(standard deviation 5.0). The population contains 441
executives (17%), 1190 white-collar workers (47%),
and 916 blue-collar workers (36%). Within the sample
of 2556 workers, 1079 cases (42.2%) with LBP of any
kind were identified at the second study phase. This prev-
alence rate of LBP is significantly higher in women as
compared to men: 413 out of 827 women (49.9%) and
666 out of 1729 men (38.5%) (P � 0.001).
Individual and physical characteristics at baseline in
cases and noncases are shown in Table 1. The prevalence
of cases with LBP is higher in participants with a lower
educational level, workers from the public sector, those
with occasional back pain at baseline, smokers, and
workers with high physical job demands. Women aged
45 years or more have more LBP than those who are
younger. LBP is more frequent in men with overweight
and obesity.
Crude associations between baseline psychosocial fac-
tors and the prevalence of LBP after a mean time interval
of 6.6 years were assessed through Cox regression anal-
yses (Table 2). The relative risk for LBP in men is signif-
icantly increased with 37% by baseline low decision lat-
itude and with approximately one fifth by baseline high
job strain, low social support at work, low wage satis-
faction, and feeling stressed at work. A nonsignificant
association is noted regarding low job satisfaction in
men. Within the female population, nonsignificant asso-
ciations are found with low decision latitude, high job
insecurity, and feeling stressed at work. No clear associ-
ations in men or women were found with psychological
job demands. Concerning psychosocial factors outside
the work environment, LBP relates primarily to feelings
of depression at baseline, with an increase in the relative

263

risk of 34% in men and 30% in women. In men, low
satisfaction with private life also slightly increased the
relative risk for LBP.
Within this study design, we could not exclude workers
with LBP at baseline because the Nordic Questionnaire was
not available. However, information was available regard-
ing occasional back pain at baseline. Additional analyses

within the subgroup of participants without occasional
back pain at baseline show associations between crude rel-
ative risks for LBP in men with low decision latitude
(relative risk 1.49; confidence interval [CI] 1.07–2.09),
high job strain (relative risk 1.21; CI 0.77–1.91), low
social support (relative risk 1.48; CI 1.06–2.08), low job
satisfaction (relative risk 1.57; CI 0.89–2.78), low wage
satisfaction (relative risk 1.56; CI 1.02–2.38), feeling
stressed at work (relative risk 1.15; CI 0.82–1.62), and
feeling depressed (relative risk 1.34; CI 0.88–2.03),
while crude relative risks for LBP in women are associ-
ated with high job insecurity (relative risk 1.10; CI 0.70–
1.74), feeling stressed at work (relative risk 1.12; CI
0.70–1.78), and feeling depressed (relative risk 1.12; CI
0.67–1.88).
In multivariate Cox regression analyses, individual
and physical risk factors were included in the full model
(Table 3). Overall, most relationships between psychos-
ocial factors and LBP are not essentially mediated by
individual or physical variables. After adjustment for in-
dividual, sociodemographic, and physical risks, the rela-
tive risk for LBP in men is significantly increased by base-
line low decision latitude (relative risk 1.20) and low
social support at work (relative risk 1.20). In men, a
borderline significant association is found with feeling
stressed at work, and nonsignificant associations with
high job strain, low job and wage satisfaction, and feel-
ing depressed. The relative risk for LBP in women is
borderline significantly increased by feeling depressed,
and nonsignificantly by high job insecurity and feeling
stressed at work.

Significant crude associations between LBP and base-
line physical job demand items were identified in men
and women, with relative risk ratio’s ranging from 1.24
to 1.43 (Table 4). After adjustment for individual and
sociodemographic variables, nonsignificant associations
are found with awkward body positions in men and
awkward arm positions in women. No interaction effects
were found between psychosocial factors and physical
job demands in relation to LBP. Controlling for physical
work factors does not reduce the strength of the associ-
ations between psychosocial factors and LBP exten-
sively.

Discussion

The aim of this longitudinal study was to explore the
impact of psychosocial risk factors on LBP. Within a
sample of 2556 middle-aged men and women, psychos-
ocial factors at baseline were related to the prevalence of
cases with LBP after a mean time interval of 6.6 years.
Although there is mounting support for the importance

of psychosocial factors in the etiology of LBP, some re-
cent reviews have emphasized the uncertainty of the ex-
act relationship due to the lack of consistency in study
results.16,17

Based on the results of this study, psychosocial factors
constitute nonnegligible risks for LBP. Moreover, most
associations are independent from occasional back pain
at baseline, as well as from other individual and physical
risk factors. Among the psychosocial work characteris-
tics, one of the significant and independent predictors of
LBP in men is baseline low social support at work. Sev-
eral studies reported that the most consistent and pro-
nounced associations with back pain were situated in the
field of worksite social support.8,9,30–33 In reviewing
prospective studies on psychosocial work characteristics
and LBP, Hoogendoorn et al6 found strong evidence for
low social support in the workplace as a risk factor. After
adjustments were made for individual and physical fac-
tors, the prevalence of LBP in men was also significantly
related with low decision latitude, and nonsignificantly

with high job strain, low job and wage satisfaction, and
feeling stressed at work. Substantial heterogeneity exists
in the literature regarding the role of low job control and
low job satisfaction in LBP. Although some reviews find
support for a positive association between these factors
and LBP,6,7,15 others contradict this.14,17 It has been sug-
gested that the influence of psychosocial factors on LBP
may not be solely related to work itself but also to the
broader nonwork-related context; therefore, it is also
important to take into account work-related perceptions
such as satisfaction with work status and income and job
stress in trying to understand the development of
LBP.13,34,35 In their review on psychosocial work factors
and LBP, Davis and Heaney16 suggested that the most
consistent associations are not found with psychosocial
work characteristics themselves but with employee re-
sponses or reactions to their work conditions. In our
longitudinal study, the prevalence of LBP is both related
to psychosocial work characteristics themselves (low de-
cision latitude and low social support in men and high
job insecurity in women), as to employee reactions to
work conditions (low job and wage satisfaction in men
and feeling stressed at work in men and women).
When assessing associations between psychosocial
factors and LBP, the emphasis in most studies is on char-
acteristics related solely to the work environment. How-
ever, psychosocial factors outside the work environment
may also play an important role in the development of
LBP. Conditions in leisure time such as satisfaction with
social contacts can exert a long-term influence on LBP.36

Conditions of psychological or emotional distress, in-
cluding depressive feelings and anxiety, have also been
related to musculoskeletal disorders and LBP.37,38 In this
study, associations were found between feeling de-
pressed and the prevalence of LBP.
Some notable gender differences were found in our
study. Overall, psychosocial work factors proved to be
important with respect to LBP, but to a lesser extent in
women as compared to men. Similar results were found
in various other studies.39–42 Hooftman et al43 recently
reviewed 14 studies regarding gender differences in the
effect of risk factors on back complaints. With respect to
the effect of job demands, job control, and job satisfac-
tion, the evidence for gender differences is inconclusive
due to inconsistent results. No evidence was found of a
gender difference in the impact of social support at the
workplace, which is not in line with the results of this
study.
An important problem in many studies exploring the
impact of psychosocial factors on LBP is the lack of
proper adjustment for other risk factors, especially phys-
ical or biomechanical workload.6,16 In our study, how-
ever, relationships between psychosocial factors and fu-
ture LBP are not essentially confounded by individual or
physical variables. This was also found in a Dutch pro-
spective cohort study in 861 workers.32

The assessment of LBP in this study was not done
through clinical examination but with a self-report mea-

sure, which inevitably includes some amount of subjec-
tivity. Nevertheless, random error in the operationaliza-
tion of LBP was minimized because of the use of the
validated and standardized Nordic questionnaire for
musculoskeletal symptoms.27 LBP in this study was iden-
tified as having had LBP for a total of 8 days or more
during the previous 12 months, which is very common.
The same analyses were conducted with a more stringent
definition: having had LBP for a total of 30 days or more
during the previous 12 months (prevalent in 21.4% of
men and 32.8% of women). This led to similar results,
although some of the associations did not reach statisti-
cal significance.
Since the Nordic questionnaire was not included in
the baseline questionnaire, it was not feasible to conduct
prospective analyses on the subsample with no LBP at
baseline. However, information was available regarding
occasional back pain at baseline. With the inclusion of
this variable in multivariate analyses, it is fair to assume
that the largest part of LBP at baseline is controlled for.
Moreover, additional analyses after exclusion of all par-
ticipants with occasional back pain at baseline roughly
engendered similar results regarding psychosocial fac-
tors and LBP.
A notable limitation of this study is that no informa-
tion is available on possible changes in exposure to psy-
chosocial factors between baseline and the assessment of
LBP at the second study phase. This is of particular im-
portance because of the relatively long time interval of
6.6 years on average. Participants whose job title
changed during the time interval were excluded. This
was done in order to rule out changes in psychosocial
work factors due to objective changes in the work envi-
ronment. Nevertheless, this does not mean that psycho-
social or physical work characteristics may not have al-
tered within the same job title. In addition, measuring
job characteristics at only one point in time increases the
risk of misclassification due to inaccuracy in assess-
ment.44 Consequently, the relationships found in our
study are probably underestimations or at least conser-
vative estimates of the truly existing associations be-
tween psychosocial factors and the development of LBP.
The presence of a selection bias in the population
should be taken into consideration when interpreting the
results. For the longitudinal results of this study, only
those workers who were involved in both phases of the
data collection were included. Within the 9 participating
companies, a total of 8783 employees had participated in
the first study phase. At the second study phase, more
than half of this original population was no longer eligi-
ble due to retirement, resignation, dismissal, or decease.
It concerns primarily workers from lower educational
levels, lower occupations, and older age groups. Within
3 companies from the secondary or manufacturing sec-
tor, major reorganizations and restructuring measures
had been carried out, as a result of which 73% of the
original study sample was no longer at work there after
the follow-up period. Some important reorganizations

266

had also taken place within 4 companies from the service
sector; 47% of the population was no longer eligible for
participation. Within 2 public administrations, 33% was
no longer eligible, which was mostly due to natural re-
tirements. Obviously, this results in a healthy worker
effect within our population. At baseline, the “drop-out”
population perceived significantly less job control. In ad-
dition, severe LBP at baseline might also be related to the
“drop-out.” Consequently, associations between psy-
chosocial factors and LBP in this study are most likely
underestimated.

Conclusions

Our results provide additional support to the findings
linking LBP to psychosocial risk factors. Both work and
nonwork-related psychosocial factors are associated
with having LBP after 6.6 years on average within a
sample of 2556 middle-aged men and women who re-
mained in the same job. Moreover, the associations are
independent from some important individual and phys-
ical risk factors, including occasional back pain at base-
line.

Key Points

● Based on the results of this study, both work and
nonwork-related psychosocial factors constitute
nonnegligible risks for LBP.
● The associations between psychosocial factors
and LBP are independent from some important in-
dividual and physical risk factors, including occa-
sional back pain at baseline.
● In women, psychosocial work factors were less
important with respect to LBP as compared to men.
