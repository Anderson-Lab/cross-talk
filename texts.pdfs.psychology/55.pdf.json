measure for specific constructs of fear-avoidance, pain-related fear, fear of movement, and kinesiophobia.\nDesign: Systematic literature search for instruments designed to measure fear of pain in patients with persistent musculoskeletal pain.\nPsychometric properties were evaluated by adjusted Wind criteria.\nResults: Five questionnaires (FearAvoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Fear-Avoidance of Pain Scale (FAPS), Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FPQ), Pain and Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS), and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)) were included in the review.\nThe main findings were that for most questionnaires, there was no underlying conceptual model to support the questionnaires construct.\nPsychometric properties were evaluated by diverse methods, which complicated comparisons of different versions of the same questionnaires.\nConstruct validity and responsiveness was generally not supported and/or untested.\nConclusion: The weak construct validity implies that no measure can currently identify who is fearful.\nThe lack of evidence for responsiveness restricts the current use of the instruments to identify clinically relevant change from treatment.\nFinally, more theoretically driven research is needed to support the construct and thus the measurement of pain-related fear.\nOver the last decennia, fear of pain and/or injury has become an integral part of our understanding in the explanation of disability in patients with persistent musculoskeletal pain [1].\nPain-related fear has been identified in the general population [2] as well as in various patients groups with persistent musculoskeletal pain [39].\nIn the clinical setting fear is acknowledged as an important aspect in patients disability which needs to be addressed to achieve successful outcome.\nAlthough the role of fear in pain-related disability seems thus well established,.\nconsensus concerning proper assessment and interpretation of fear in relation to pain is currently still lacking.\nThese are, however, constructs rather than a disorder or other pathological state in and of itself.\n1982 in the fear-avoidance model of exaggerated pain perception [12], in which fear and pain were both presented as associated with behaviour through avoidance learning.\npresented their thoughts about kinesiophobia [13].\nKinesiophobia was originally defined as a condition in which a patient has an excessive, irrational, and debilitating fear of physical movement and activity resulting from a feeling of vulnerability to painful injury or reinjury.\nThe model that has gained most interest among researchers and clinicians alike is the cognitive-behavioural fear-avoidance model [14].\nIn that model fear of movement was identified as an important factor to result in disability, disuse, and depression in patients with persistent musculoskeletal pain.\nA subsequent construct is pain-related fear [15], defined as fear that incorporates fear of pain, fear of injury, fear of physical activity, and so forth.\nIn the literature, the above-mentioned constructs are often used interchangeably, although they are not synonyms.\nTherefore, it seems that, currently, the conceptual framework of the various constructs used in relation to fear and pain are far from clear.\nDespite the limited evidence available concerning the underlying constructs, over years several questionnaires have already been developed for the assessment of fear in relation to pain [16, 18, 19].\nThe Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) is the oldest existing measure and was designed 1991 by Miller et al.\nThe Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaires (FABQ) [16] and the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS) [18] were subsequently developed.\nThese questionnaires are currently all used in research as well in clinical practice, in order to identify problem areas and to aid in the design of targeted treatment strategies for the patient.\nHowever, no systematic evaluation of the psychometric properties of the existing measures has ever been performed.\nTherefore, the aims of the present study were threefold; first to identify the existing measures, second to review the measurement properties, and thirdly to identify the optimum measure for specific constructs fear-avoidance, pain-related fear, fear of movement and kinesiophobia.\nA systematic literature search for instruments specifically designed to measure fear of pain in patients with persistent pain was performed.\nFirst the search items assessment and pain were combined with the subordinate terms fear avoidance, pain-related fear, fear of movement, and kinesiophobia.\nVerbunt) was consulted in order to obtain a consensus.\nThe review criteria included an evaluation of the following psychometric steps: Conceptual and measurement model, reliability, validity, responsiveness, interpretability, practicality, and cross-cultural applicability [20].\nTo assess the levels of the psychometric steps mentioned above we used criteria adjusted after Wind et al.\nThe following definitions were used in the current study.\nReliability can be assessed based on various subconstructs.\nMeasurement Validity refers to the extent to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure [22, 23, 25].\nFor the purpose of this study validity will be presented as face-, content-, construct-, and criterion-related validity [20].\nResponsiveness describes the instruments ability to detect change.\nInterpretability describes the degree to which one can assign easily understood meaning to an instruments quantitative scores.\nPracticality refers to aspects as time, effort, and other demands placed on those on which the instrument is being administered (respondent burden) or on those who administer the instrument (administrative burden).\nFor the purpose of this study, we have chosen to evaluate the cross-cultural adaptation separately for each instrument.\nThe initial search strategy identified 588 abstracts from the PubMed, Cinahl, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases.\nAfter removing duplicates, 37 abstracts were retrieved for further review.\nOf the 37 articles, 13 articles addressed the FABQ, one article the FAPS, 2 articles the FPQ, 10 articles the PASS, and 12 articles the TSK.\nThe results are presented as a brief summary of the assessment of the measurement properties of all questionnaires (Table 2).\nIn addition, a more detailed overview of the included articles is presented in Table 3.\nStability over time (i) test-retest.\nPercentage of agreement %

Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) was identified to measure kinesiophobia.\nDescriptions of the Included Questionnaires.\nThe FearAvoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) was originally developed by Waddell et al.\n[33] to assess fear-avoidance beliefs in patients with back pain.\nThe original version of the FABQ contains 16 items divided into two subscales: fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity (5 items) and fear-avoidance beliefs about work (11 items).\nThe Fear Avoidance of Pain Scale (FAPS) was constructed by Crowley and Kendall [42] to measure fear avoidance of activities.\nThe FAPS comprises 21 items ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (all the time).\nPatients are asked to rate how often the mentioned activity occurs.\nThe Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FPQ) is presented to measure fear of pain and is based on the work of Lethem et al.\nThe FPQ versions used in the two included articles consist both of a total number of 30 items, but the individual items included differ however in both articles.\nThe FPQ items are statements briefly describing painful situations, and the patient is asked to mark the amount of fear on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (extreme) for each item.\nThree subscales are reported: fear of minor, severe, and medical pain.\nA total score is used.\nThe Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS) was originally designed to assess fear of pain [18] in relation to the three response modalities: cognitive, physiological, or motor response domains.\nThe patients are asked to rate their score for each item on a scale from 0 (never) to 5 (always).\nItems on the PASS are measured on a 6-point Likert scale.\nDifferent versions of the PASS exist including the 53-item questionnaire and an abbreviated version consisting of 20 items.\nThe Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) was designed to measure kinesiophobia [19].\nThe original TSK consists of 17 items.\nEach item is evaluated on a 4-point Likert scale with scoring alternatives ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.\nA total sum is calculated after inversion of the individual scores of items 4, 8, 12, and 16.\nThe total score can vary from 17 to 68.\nFor instance, the various English language versions contain 4, 11, 13, or 17 items.\nGeneral Summary according to the Psychometric Properties for All Questionnaires.\nExtensive work on the definition of psychometric properties has been performed on the FABQ and the TSK.\nAt present, the FABQ appeared to be the best available measure, in terms of psychometric properties, to measure the concept fearavoidance beliefs, the PASS seems to be the best available measure to measure pain-related fear, and the TSK is the best available to measure kinesiophobia.\nAs shown in Table 2, for various questionnaires information concerning reliability and validity is often lacking.\nIn addition, for almost all measures evidence to confirm its responsiveness is lacking.\nEach identified measure is analysed in depth below.\nFear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ).\nIn total, 16 articles were included in the review of the FABQ.\nThese articles addressed the psychometric properties of the Chinese [29, 30], Dutch [31, 32], English [16, 34], French [35], German [3638], Greek [39], Hebrews [40], Norwegian [27], and Spanish language versions [41], with each language version presented separately (Tables 2 and 3).\nAs shown in Table 2 the internal consistency of the FABQtotal as well as its subscale FABQwork was assessed as high in all language versions.\nHowever, the internal consistency of the subscale FABQphysicalactivity appeared to be only low to moderate in most language versions.\nThe FABQ reproducibility as reported ranged from low to high, whereas the reported FABQ validity could be classified as low.\nThe quality of the FABQ validity analysis procedures as performed could be classified as compromised.\nStudy objectives were often not clearly focussed, which complicated identifying the validation procedure as performed.\nAs shown in Table 2, only limited information appeared to be available related to the FABQs content validity.\nMost often, the construct validity was assessed using factor analyses.\nVarious factor solutions were presented ranging from one to four, with two being the most common factor solution.\nThe items within the factor solutions varied, but were mostly robust.\nAs shown in Table 3, a variety of measures were used to either converge or diverge in relation to the FABQ.\nTesting conditions were not reported in any of the studies.\nThe criterion-related validity, both concurrent and predictive, of the FABQ was ranging from low to moderate.\nThe presentation of the rationale for the choice of the criterionrelated measures was often lacking, which complicated the interpretation.\nOne article appeared to be available that evaluated the psychometric properties of the FAPS.\nBased on this information, the internal consistency is considered as high whereas its reproducibility seems low.\nConcurrent validity was ranging from low to moderate.\nMoreover, the evidence supporting validity of the FAPS is poor in all versions.\nIt is also unclear what subscale of the FAPS would be preferable to use.\nConceptual Incorporates fear of pain, fear of injury, fear of physical activity.\nAn excessive, irrational, and debilitating fear of physical movement and activity resulting from a feeling of vulnerability to painful injury or.\nFear-avoidance of Pain questionnaire (FAPQ).\nFear of pain questionnaire (FPQ).\nFear of Pain Questionnaire (FPQ).\nThe FPQ measures fear of pain and is to be based on the work of Lethem et al.\nThe FPQ as referred to in the two articles included in the final selection consisted of 30 items.\nAll items describe painful situations, and the patient is asked to mark the amount of fear he/she is experiencing related to each item on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (extreme).\nThe three subscales mentioned are fear of minor, severe, and medical pain.\nA total score is used.\nAs reported the internal consistency varied between low in the medical scale to high in the total scale.\nThe content validity was considered low.\nThe reliability was high in all PASS language.\nversions, except for the English 20-item version of the subscale PASSphysiologicalsymptomsof anxiety which was reported to be only moderate.\nContent validity ranged between low and moderate in the English and the French versions of the PASS.\nConstruct validity was found to be low in the combined Dutch and American study [46].\nConcurrent validity was low to moderate in the Dutch and English version of the PASS [59].\nResponsiveness was addressed in only one study.\nIn addition to the original version, two versions of the PASS are available in Dutch.\nA total number of 12 articles addressed the psychometric properties of the Dutch [5052], English [5356], Norwegian [57], and Swedish version of the TSK [7].\nReliability was not evaluated at all in the Norwegian version of the TSK.\nThe reliability of the English version ranged from low in the 13-item version subscale TSKtsf [55] to high in TSKtotal.\nThe reliability of the various Dutch versions ranged from low on the 13-items subscale TSKpathologicsomaticfocus to high on the TSKtotal in a group of patients with Fibromyalgia.\nThe support for reliability of the Swedish version was found to be high in a group of patients with persistent low back pain [7].\nValidity was found to be low in all versions of the TSK.\nAll questionnaires had weaknesses in relation to their psychometric properties, poor reliability and validity indicating a lack of construct validity.\nAt present the FABQ seems to be the best available questionnaire to measure the concept fear-avoidance beliefs, the PASS seems to be the best available questionnaire to measure pain-related fear, and the TSK is the best used to measure kinesiophobia.\nAs shown in this study the description of the underlying conceptual model appeared to be poor (FABQ, FAPQ, PASS) to nonexistent (TSK).\nAs a consequence of that, it is currently unclear how individual scores obtained from either of these questionnaires could be interpreted for research and clinical settings.\nAlthough in clinical practice several of the presented questionnaires are already frequently in use in order to screen individual patients for fear related to pain, based on the results of this review, it could be concluded that the interpretation of the scoring has to be performed with caution.\nFor example, what would be the clinical relevance of a high score on the FABQ? Based on the results of the current review, it can only be concluded that in such a situation, a patient who has elevated scores on the FABQ cannot be interpreted as having high fear-avoidance beliefs.\n[60] agrees with this finding.\nIn one of their studies, patients showed a clinical relevant decrease in their fear-avoidance beliefs as observed by the rehabilitation staff, although this change was not represented in a change in TSKscoring.\nPatients continued to have high scores even after successful participation in the treatment.\nThis finding may suggest that the construct validity of the TSK version used was poor as the questionnaire did not target fear as it was intended to or that the measure was not sensitive enough to pick up the actual clinical change.\nIt can be concluded that there is an ambiguity in relation to the conceptual framework, and there are several different constructs to define what fear is in relation to pain.\nIt should be emphasized that none of the measures seem to be explicitly based on the frequently referred to and well-established cognitive-behavioural fear-avoidance model [14].\nFAPS, FPQ, PASS and TSK) were already designed before the introduction of Vlaeyens fear avoidance model in 1995.\nThis fear avoidance model has been further elaborated on by several other researchers [6163].\nIn addition, two recent models have tried to incorporate alternative activity-related behavioural strategies, among these are the Ergomania model [64] and the Avoidance-Endurance model [65].\nIn summary, there seems to be a discrepancy between the moment the measures and the conceptual models available on fear related to pain were introduced.\nThis leads to the question, what the questionnaires in their current versions really measure.\nThe Link between Models and Measures.\nClosely linked to the conceptual framework is the validity of each questionnaire.\nIn the current study, the evaluation of the evidence concerning validity was complex.\nIt must however be noted that establishing validity of an instrument is extremely difficult [26] what seems to imply that no questionnaire can be labelled as 100% valid [66].\nIn the current study, firstly, the validation procedure was often poorly described, complicating quality judgment of this procedure.\nSome of the authors, however, succeeded to guide the reader through the procedure [27, 54].\nSecondly, a variety of measures were used as external criterion in the concurrent/criterion validity process.\nAs shown in Table 3 all of the selected questionnaires were validated against other questionnaires as part of the validation process.\nHowever, the validity of the instrument used as the gold standard appeared to be in many occasions less established as it was assumed.\nBased on the results of the current review, it was shown that the FABQ, PASS, and TSK were all used to evaluate the validity of a reference instrument which has been included during the original validity evaluation of the questionnaire itself.\nBased on this circular reasoning, it can however only be concluded that both instruments measure the same construct, but whether this construct is indeed the desired construct is still unknown.\nFor instance, studying the association between the TSK and the FABQ will result in information regarding the construct validity [67] of the questionnaires, but will not evaluate the concurrent/criterion validity for which a gold standard scale is required.\nIn the articles reviewed, most authors referred indeed to the validation as an evaluation of construct/convergent rather than concurrent/criterion validity.\nHowever, it should be noted that even if the term for the validation is used properly, the weakness of construct/convergent validity is still present.\nMoreover, whether a test is valid or not is ultimately a matter of opinion based on the evidence available describing its validity [26].\nSome researchers have argued that an evaluation of construct validity is the only proper way to evaluate the validity of an instrument [22, 26].\nDuring construct validity evaluations, three essential steps have to be taken.\nFirstly, the domain of observables related to the construct has to be specified; secondly, the extent to which observables tend to measure the same construct has to be determined; thirdly studies and/or experiments have to be performed.\nBased on the results of our review, it can be concluded that the information currently available on psychometric properties of the instruments is too limited to establish their quality as diagnostic tests.\nFor example, at the moment evidence-based cut-off scores for the various instruments are still not available.\nIn addition, the limited information regarding responsiveness of the questionnaires complicates the use in clinical practice, since information on a clinically relevant change of an instrument is not available.\nInformation on responsiveness was only available for the FABQ (German, French, Norwegian, Spanish, and Chinese versions and the TSK 11-item English version).\nWhether these instruments are applicable for screening patients for pain-related fear seems an important topic for future research.\nTo support the appropriateness as an outcome measure, more information must be gathered on the responsiveness of the various measures.\nBoth interpretability and practicality are seldom discussed in published articles, even though the evaluation of both constructs seem highly relevant in the questionnaire selection process.\nIn clinical practice, both criteria seem relevant and need to be highlighted for future research.\nDuring cross-validation, both language and cultural differences should be taken into account.\nThis review was based on an evaluation of psychometric properties.\nIt is evident that there is no such thing as a gold standard criteria for psychometric testing.\n[68] and Larsen and Marx [69].\nWe would also like to clarify that the rationale for using criteria instead of simply presenting the data as shown in Table 3 was to provide a guidance for the reader who is trying to decide which measure to use.\nThere are, however, other methods available to evaluate reliability and validity.\nPsychometric theory assumes that the data is normally distributed and treated as data on at least an interval level, while others argue that data from questionnaires are ordinal data [70, 71].\nAnother model available for evaluation of measurement quality is the Rasch Model.\n[73], Rasch models [50, 52] are logistic models in item response theory in which a persons level on a latent trait and the various items on the same latent variable can be estimated independently.\nThe Rasch model was applied to the Norwegian version of the TSK by Damsgard et al.\nOther instruments often presented in association with the evaluated constructs are the Photographs Series of Daily Activities (PHODA) [74] the Pain Beliefs Screening Instrument (PBS) [75], Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire [76], and the Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (PAIRS) [77].\nThese instruments were not included in this review for various reasons.\nThe PHODA was not identified as part of the search, since it was originally presented in Dutch.\nFurthermore, it is designed to determine the level of perceived harmfulness of various physical activities and movements.\nBoth the PBS and the Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire are designed to screen patients at risk of developing persistent pain whereas the PAIRS was designed to assess beliefs about chronic pain and functional impairment and were not included for further evaluation in the current review.\nAnother issue to be raised is the statement that there is an (over)reliance on self-reports [78] for both constructs (fear and pain).\nVerbal reports as well as the other methods (observation by others and instrument/apparatus) have both their limitations [78].\nThe best methods of assessment are multimodal and multimethod.\nHowever, such an analysis is not always possible in a clinical setting.\nOnce again, we need to be cautious when interpreting the results.\nIn conclusion, evidence supporting the psychometric properties of questionnaires which are currently available to measure fear of pain in patients with musculoskeletal pain is still incomplete.\nFuture research on the validity of fear of pain measures seems warranted.\nIn order to facilitate the clinical application of these instruments, it is recommended that the focus of research be on an agreement of the conceptual and operational definitions of the various constructs.\npsychometric procedures with a qualitative approach, in order to be
