sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors.\nPain-related fear, often assessed through self-reports such as questionnaires, has shown prognostic value and clinical utility for a variety of musculoskeletal pain disorders.\nHowever, it remains difficult to determine a common underlying construct of pain-related fear due to several proposed constructs among questionnaires.\nThe current study describes a novel neuroscientific approach using machine learning of neural patterns within the fear circuit of chronic low back pain patients that has the potential to identify neural commonalities or differences among the various constructs.\nUltimately, this approach might afford a deeper understanding of the suggested constructs and might be also applied to other domains where ambiguity exists between different psychological constructs.\nHowever, the validity of self-reports is limited (Choi and Pak, 2005), probably also because often overlapping psychological constructs are assessed, illustrated by the fact that various questionnaires attempt to assess related constructs.\nFor the assessment of PRF, various questionnaires exist based on potentially different constructs such as fear of movement/injury and reinjury/kinesiophobia, fear avoidance beliefs, or pain anxiety.\nThere is an open debate on what their scores reflect on the fearanxiety spectrum (Lundberg et al.\nWhile PRF questionnaires do not clearly distinguish between these emotions (Lundberg et al.\n, 2011; Kreddig and Hasenbring, 2017), brain research provides evidence for a functional differentiation of fear and anxiety.\n, 2015); however, subcortical regions (e.\n, the amygdala) seem to be more involved in fast and defensive fear reactions (short defensive distance to threat) while cortical regions (e.\n, the prefrontal cortex) are more likely to be responsible for complex cognitions of anxiety (large defensive distance to threat; McNaughton and Corr, 2004; Qi et al.\nTherefore, advances in neuroimaging enable exploring the subcortical/cortical contributions to PRF constructs by examining interrelations between self-reported emotional states and brain response patterns.\nThe label may have discrete (classification) or continuous (regression) values such as questionnaire scores (Formisano et al.\n, bending and lifting).\nTherefore, we provoked PRF by presenting video clips of daily activities including bending and lifting (harmful condition) and harmless activities such as walking (harmless condition) in a sample of 20 patients with nonspecific chronic LBP.\nWe applied a pattern regression analysis in combination with multiple kernel learning (MKL) to assess potential neural predictors of the various PRF constructs based on the weighting of (1) harmful and harmless conditions (condition weights) and (2) pattern information within subcortical and cortical fear-processing regions (region weights).\nWe first contrasted the different PRF questionnaires in terms of their model performance, namely the ability of the model to predict the questionnaire scores based on brain response patterns across fear-processing regions.\nSecond, we compared the different prediction models according to the distributions of their condition and region weights to explore potential neural commonalities or differences of related PRF constructs.\nIf the PRF questionnaires share overlapping PRF constructs, then the region weights should be similarly distributed across fear-processing regions.\nConversely, if the contributing brain regions vary across the prediction models, this would provide evidence for nonoverlapping PRF constructs across questionnaires.\nUltimately, this approach might help to further understand and dissect the various PRF constructs in chronic LBP.\nPatients The study was approved by the Ethics Committee Zurich (Switzerland), and all patients provided written informed consent before participation.\nWe recruited a total of 20 patients (mean age, 39.\n35

we also calculated the questionnaire scores of the 13and 11-item TSK versions (TSK-13, TSK-11).\n, 2004; Tkachuk and Harris, 2012).\nA two-factor solution of the TSK-11 version provides the best fit in terms of explaining variance across German, Dutch, Swedish, and Canadian samples, and included the subscales activity-avoidance (TSK-AA; the belief that that activity may result in injury/reinjury or stronger pain) and somatic focus (TSK-SF; the belief in underlying and serious medical problems; Roelofs et al.\n(2) The German version of the fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ; Waddell et al.\n, 1993; Pfingsten et al.\n, 2000) consists of 16 back pain-specific items related to fear avoidance beliefs rated on a 7-point rating scale (0, completely disagree; 6, completely agree).\nIt includes two distinct and established subscales related to beliefs about about how work (FABQ-W) and physical activity (FABQ-PA) affect LBP, with internal consistencies of   0.\nand relate to four different subscales, including cognitive anxiety (PASS-C), fear (PASS-F), physiology (PASS-P), and escape/avoidance (PASS-E; Roelofs et al.\nFurthermore, patients were asked to fill out the painDETECT questionnaire, which includes three 11-point numeric rating scales, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst imaginable pain to assess current pain, strongest, and average pain intensity in the previous 4 weeks (Freynhagen et al.\nFinally, to investigate potential differences or shared variance between PRF and general anxiety, we used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the most widely used self-report measure of anxiety, which includes two subscales (Spielberger and Gorsuch, 1983; Julian, 2011): the State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety) assesses current levels of anxiety, whereas the Trait Anxiety Scale (T-Anxiety) evaluates more stable aspects of anxiety such as anxiety proneness (Julian, 2011).\nAll questionnaires were administered at the fMRI appointment before brain scanning.\nWe tested the scores of the different questionnaires for the assumption of normality of the data using the ShapiroWilk test and visually using QQ plots implemented in SPSS Statistics (version 23, IBM; Ghasemi and Zahediasl, 2012).\nEach imaging session started with a survey scan, a B1 calibration scan (for MultiTransmit), and a SENSE reference scan.\nHigh-resolution anatomic data

al.\nThe video clips showed potentially harmful activities (back-straining movements such as bending and lifting) selected from the Photograph Series of Daily Activities (PHODA; Leeuw et al.\nThe original PHODA was developed in close collaboration with human movement scientists, physical therapists, and psychologists, and is composed of a fear hierarchy based on ratings of the perceived harmfulness of daily activities in patients with chronic LBP.\nFrom the 40 potentially harmful activities included in the short electronic PHODA version (Leeuw et al.\n, 2007a), we chose three scenarios from the top six most harmful activities, namely shoveling soil with a bent back, lifting a flowerpot with slightly bent back, and vacuum cleaning under a coffee table with a bent back.\nFurthermore, we created video clips of three activities rated as less harmful, such as walking up and down the stairs and walking on even ground (harmless condition).\nPresentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems) was used to present the video clips in a pseudorandomized order (no more than two identical consecutive trials).\nThe patients were asked to carefully observe the video clips, which were displayed using MRcompatible goggles (Resonance Technology).\nThe three harmful and harmless activities were each presented five times (30 trials total).\nAfter the observation of each video clip, the patients were asked to rate the perceived harmfulness of the activity on a visual analog scale (VAS) anchored with the endpoints not harmful at all (0) and extremely harmful (10).\nAll ratings were performed using an MR-compatible track ball (Current Designs).\nAfter the VAS rating, a black screen with a green fixation cross appeared (duration jittered between 6 and 8 s).\ndata obtained in neuroimaging experiments.\n, 2011), which requires minimal user input and provides easily interpretable and comprehensive error and output reporting.\nThis processing pipeline includes state-of-the-art software packages for each step of preprocessing (for a detailed description of the different workflows, see https://fmriprep.\nEach T1w volume was skullstripped using

half-maximum 4 mm Gaussian kernel was applied.\nuk/spm/) for model computation using a general linear model (GLM).\nThe video clips were modeled as boxcar functions (onset  onset of video clip; duration  4 s) and convolved with the standard canonical hemodynamic response function, as implemented in SPM12.\nthe GLM model for each patient: (1) the six regressors derived from the component-based physiologic noise correction method (aCompCor) and (2) the motion-related regressors generated by AROMA (see MR data organization and preprocessing section).\nFinally, for each patient, voxelwise  images for each condition were computed and served as the input images for the MVPA.\nMultivariate pattern analysis Compared with univariate analyses, MVPA can achieve greater sensitivity and is able to detect subtle and spatially distributed effects (Schrouff et al.\n, 2013; Haynes, 2015).\nA pattern of activity can represent many more different states than each voxel individually, which leads to an information-based view compared with the activation-based view of univariate analyses (Hebart and Baker, 2017).\nMVPA was performed using routines implemented in PRoNTo version 2.\nFor the readout of multivariate neural information that might serve as a potential score estimator of the different PRF questionnaires, we applied a newly introduced pattern regression approach based on supervised machine learning and testing phases using MKL.\nIn brief, the objective in supervised pattern recognition regression analysis is to learn a function from data that can accurately predict the continuous values (labels; i.\n, f(xi)  yi from a given dataset D  {xi, yi}, i  1.\nN, where xi represents pairs of samples or vectors and yi represents the different labels).\nMKL allows accounting for brain anatomy (determined by a brain atlas; see Feature selection) and different modalities (e.\n, anatomic/ functional data or in the current approach: conditions) during the model estimation by considering each brain region and modality as separate kernels.\nThis approach allows determination of the contribution of each brain region (region weights) and condition (condition weights) to the final decision function of the model in a hierarchical manner by simultaneously learning and combining the different linear kernels that are based on support vector machines (SVMs; Rakotomamonjy et al.\n, 2008; Fernandes et al.\n, 2017; Schrouff et al.\nCompared with conventional MVPA methods based on whole-brain voxel weight maps, this procedure provides a straightforward approach to draw inferences on the region level without the need for multiple comparison correction (Schrouff et al.\nTo account for possible differential contributions of the harmful and harmless conditions to the decision function, we included the individual SPM  images of each condition as separate modalities in the MKL model (condition weights).\nSubsequently, for each questionnaire, we trained a separate MKL regression model with the respective labels (FABQ, TSK-17-, TSK-13, TSK-11, PASS and all subscale scores,.\nFurthermore, we trained MKL regression models based on the harmfulness ratings collected during the fMRI measurements (mean ratings of the harmful condition and harmless condition, respectively).\nThis resulted in a total of 17 MKL models providing outputs for model evaluation, including model performance, region, and conditions weights.\n1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]).\nMultiple-comparison correction for the model performance (r values and nMSE) was based on a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% (p(FDR)  0.\nIn addition, each model representing a potential PRF construct [i.\n, a model with a significant (FDR corrected and uncorrected) performance] was trained and tested through an additional cross-validation procedure using each predictive feature set (brain regions that contributed 10%; see Table 5) of the other models (betweenmodel cross-validation; e.\n, training and testing of the FABQ labels was repeated using the predictive feature sets of the TSK-11, TSK-13, and T-Anxiety models).\nA failure of predictive performance in the between-model crossvalidation would point toward a dissociation of brain regions contributing to the different models and would therefore be indicative of nonoverlapping PRF constructs.\n, 2014; Tovote et al.\nThe respective brain regions were parcellated according to the automated anatomic labeling (AAL; RRID: SCR_003550; http://www.\nfr/en/tools/aal-aal2/; see Table 5 for the different labels; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.\nBrainSuite was also used to generate surfaces of the selected AAL regions for visualization.\n, 2017), as follows: Pearsonss correlation coefficient (r) and the.\nThe correlation coefficient characterizes the linear relationship between true and predicted labels; the MSE is calculated as the average of the squared differences between the true and predicted labels.\nFurthermore, for each model, we report the nMSE because the different questionnaires are based on different score ranges.\nProviding a quantification of this variability, the expected ranking (ER; see Table 5) characterizes the stability of the region ranking across folds, as follows: The closer the ER to the ranking of the selected fold, the more consistent is the ranking of the respective brain region across folds.\nOn the other hand, if the ER is different from the ranking, this means that the ranking might be variable across folds.\nRatings, questionnaire scores, and correlations Importantly, the comparison of the ratings during fMRI measurements demonstrated that the potentially harmful activities were perceived as being significantly more harmful compared with the harmless activities (paired t test: T  8.\nDescriptive statistics of the different questionnaires as well as the age and sex of the patients are summarized in Table 1.\nRegarding the questionnaire data, visual inspection (Q-Q plots) and the ShapiroWilk test indicated the non-normality of the data (p  0.\nMost of the TSK scales significantly correlated with the PASSs (0.\n05), whereas the FABQ work scale did not show significant relationships with the TSK and PASSs (p  0.\n05), except for the PASS-F (r  0.\nFurthermore, only the S-Anxiety scale of the STAI scale demonstrated significant correlations with some, but not all, TSK scales (0.\nFinally, only the PASS-F showed a positive and significant relationship with the mean rating of the harmful condition (r  0.\nThe FABQ model demonstrated a significant decoding performance characterized by a positive correlation between true and predicted labels (r  0.\n25, p(uncorr)  0.\nInterestingly, the FABQ-W model showed strong predictive power (r  0.\n003), whereas the FABQ-PA scale was not decodable from fear-related brain response patterns (r  0.\n68, p(uncorr)  0.\nAmong the TSK scales, only the TSK-13 (r  0.\n37, p(uncorr)  0.\n09, p(uncorr)  0.\n033) and the TSK-11 (r  0.\n19, p(uncorr)  0.\n10, p(uncorr)  0.\n73, p(uncorr)  0.\n86, p(uncorr)  0.\n63, p(uncorr)  0.\n88, p(uncorr)  0.\n18, p(uncorr)  0.\n63,

of models with predictive performance (p  0.\n05, FDR-corrected and uncorrected; see Model performance) are illustrated in Figure 1AE and are described in detail in Table 5 (sections AE).\nThe decoding performances of the FABQ models (FABQ and FABQ-W) were driven by a major contribution of the harmful condition (88% and 87%, respectively).\nWithin this condition, the left thalamus (rank 1), the right amygdala (rank 2) and the left hippocampus (rank 3) contributed 69% of the total region weights in the FABQ model (Table 5, section A, Fig.\nSimilarly, the right amygdala (rank 1) and the left thalamus (rank 2) carried the most predictive neural information with 79.\ndition, although it was of minor relevance (11%).\nIn comparison, the TSK models demonstrated a moderate contribution of the harmful condition (TSK-13, 60%; TSK11, 66%).\nBoth predictive model performances of the TSK were driven by a major contribution of the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC; TSK-13, 52.\n49%; Table 5, sections C and D, Fig.\nFurthermore, the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and the right hippocampus carried predictive information within the harmless condition in both TSK models (TSK-13: left gyrus rectus, 19.\n51%; right hippocampus, 14.\n03%; TSK11: left gyrus rectus, 21.\n29%; right hippocampus, 10.\n(52%) and harmless conditions (48%), the prediction of the T-Anxiety scores was mainly driven by neural contributions of the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mOFC (accounting for 44% of the total region weights in the harmful condition) and the left thalamus (together with the mOFC accounting for 44% of the total region weights in the harmless condition; Table 5, section E, Fig.\nDiscussion Evidence from cross-sectional and longitudinal behavioral studies demonstrates a strong association between PRF and disability in chronic pain (Leeuw et al.\nTable 2: Spearmans rank correlations between the different pain-related fear questionnaires.\ndifferent PRF constructs such as fear of movement/ (re)injury/kinesiophobia, fear avoidance beliefs, or pain anxiety are often used interchangeably in the literature (Lundberg et al.\n, 2011), and it is unclear whether they share a common PRF construct reflected by similar neural sources.\nThe subcortical/cortical neural basis of fear and anxiety that controls cognition and regulates appropriate behavior dependent on threat characteristics is well described (Gray and MacNaughton, 2000; LeDoux, 2000; McNaughton and Corr, 2004; Panksepp, 2011;.\n, 2015), anxiety is less well understood and more complex than fear.\nCurrent research suggests a functional differentiation characterized by subcortical regions processing fast fear responses to an imminent threat (defensive responses) and cortical systems processing complex cognitions related to fear and anxiety where the threat is distal in space or time (LeDoux and Pine, 2016; Qi et al.\nThe model performance (r, MSE) characterizes the strength of the relationship between true and predicted labels.\nCondition and region weights show the predictive contribution of the two different conditions (harmful, harmless) and fear-related brain regions (parcellated according to the AAL atlas; L, left; R, right) to the final decision function of each MKL model (questionnaires AE with model performance; p  0.\nBrain regions (feature set) were identified as follows: thalamus (1); hippocampus (2); amygdala (3); insula (4); mOFC: rectus (5), Frontal_Sup_Orb (6), Frontal_Med_Orb (7); lOFC: Frontal_Mid_Orb (8), Frontal_Inf_Orb (9), mPFC: Frontal_Sup_Medial (10); anterior cingulate cortex: Cingulum_Ant (11).\nThe current MVPA approach using MKL demonstrated the feasibility to neuronally dissect the proposed constructs of PRF self-reports based on their subcortical/ cortical predictors during PRF-related brain activity.\nThe results revealed that while the variability across individuals of some questionnaires, specifically the FABQ and FABQ-W, TSK-13, TSK-11, and T-Anxiety scales, was predictable from response patterns in fear-related, dissociable neural sources on subcortical and cortical levels, this was not the case for the FABQ-PA, the TSK-11 subscales (TSK-11-AA and TSK-SF), the PASSs, and the S-Anxiety scale.\nFurthermore, the on-line ratings of perceived harmfulness were not decodable from fear-related brain response patterns.\nFABQ and TSK The FABQ and FABQ-W scales demonstrated the best model performances among the investigated PRF questionnaires, which were characterized by a strong contribution of neural information in the harmful condition (condition weights, 88% and 87%, respectively).\nThe better model performance of the FABQ-W based on fearrelated brain activity patterns is in line with the emerging evidence that the FABQ-W is a better predictor of treat-.\nment outcome in chronic LBP compared with the FABQPA, although this might be dependent on the patient population (Waddell et al.\n, 1993; George et al.\n, 2005, 2008; Wertli et al.\nIn support of this, the FABQ-W scale qualified for a clinical prediction rule regarding improvement after spinal manipulation, whereas the FABQ-PA scale did not (Flynn et al.\n, 2002; Dougherty et al.\nWith respect to the region weights, the FABQ models were mainly driven by subcortical neural contributions involving the thalamus, hippocampus, and the amygdala, while frontal brain regions played a minor role.\nThe thalamus and, particularly, its midline structures have been considered to be a nonspecific arousing system (van der Werf et al.\nHowever, it has been shown recently that parts of dorsal midline thalamic structures are necessary for fear memory processing by directly targeting the hippocampus, which plays an important role for context-dependent emotional memory (Penzo et al.\n, 2015; Lara-Vsquez et al.\n, 2016; Zheng et al.\nFurthermore, the amygdala has long been considered a fear center (Darwin, 1873; Panksepp, 1998).\nHowever, the heterogeneous structure consisting of several nuclei is not essential for the experience of fear, which has been demonstrated in patients with amygdala lesions (Anderson and Phelps, 2002; Feinstein et al.\nA recent opinion article (LeDoux and Hofmann, 2018) suggested that subjective feelings of fear and anxiety do not initially arise from subcortical activity of the fear circuit centered around the amygdala.\nThus, amygdala activity and mediated physiologic responses of fear and anxiety might be, at its best, only a correlate of subjective feelings of fear and anxiety (LeDoux and Hofmann, 2018).\nNevertheless, the results presented here indicate a strong predictive association between subjective reports of PRF, assessed by the FABQ scales, and amygdala activity patterns.\nMKL model r p value nMSE p value FABQ total 0.\n475 Ratings harmful activities 0.\nFeature set FABQ total labels FABQ-W labels TSK-11 labels TSK-13 labels T-Anxiety labels FABQ total r

activities, 48%.\nBrain regions included in the feature set for between model cross-validation (see Table 4 for results).\nInterestingly, no predictive association could be learned by MKL using the TSK-11 subscale labels (TSK-11-SF and TSK-11-AA scores).\nAlthough these two lower-order factors (activity avoidance and somatic focus) are reflective of the higher-order construct fear of movement and (re)injury/kinesiophobia, the nonsignificant result might indicate that they are associated with inconsistent neural patterns across individuals.\nRegarding the region weights of the TSK models, the right lOFC provided the most predictive information for the two TSK scales (TSK-13, 52%; TSK-11, 60%).\nIn agreement with the phobia-related construct (kinesiophobia), dysfunction of the OFC has been shown to be implicated in the processing of phobia-related stimuli in disorders such as social anxiety disorder (Dilger et al.\nSpecifically, lOFC activity was reduced when phobogenic trials were contrasted with fear-relevant trials (Aue et al.\nFurthermore, a hyperactive lOFC has been shown to be linked to anxiety-laden cognitions (Hahn et al.\nInterestingly, the higher cortical contributions of the TSK models were clearly dissociable from the largely subcortical contributions involving the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus that predicted the FABQ scores.\nTo conclude, the FABQ scales demonstrated high PRF sensitivity (harmful condition weights  87%) and were linked to subcortical predictors that have been associated with fear responses to an imminent threat and defensive behavior (McNaughton and Corr, 2004; LeDoux and Pine, 2016).\nIn support of this, the observed higher harmless condition weights of the TSK compared with the FABQ models might indicate that the TSK scales are associated with more diffuse anxiety-related cognitions.\nThere may be several explanations.\nFirst, although the FABQ and the TSK have been specifically developed for patients with musculoskeletal pain, the PASS is suitable for various pain phenotypes (Crombez et al.\nSecond, the PASS has been shown to be more strongly associated with negative affect and less predictive of pain disability and behavioral performance (Crombez et al.\nThird, all PASS subscales demonstrated significant multicollinearity in our sample, suggesting nonindependence between the different subscales.\nAll these aspects may have led to less sensitivity of fear-related neural patterns to the PASS and its subscales in the current study.\nThe superiority of the FABQ scale (driven by the FABQ-W) in decoding performance compared with the TSK and PASSs might also be influenced by the backspecific items of the FABQ in conjunction with the nature of the PRF-provoking stimuli (back-straining movements).\nThe items of the FABQ were specifically related to the back, while the TSK and PASS can be used with various.\nmusculoskeletal pain diagnoses such as work-related upper extremity disorders, chronic LBP, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis (Roelofs et al.\nNevertheless, the FABQ has also been adapted to shoulder pain, where it demonstrated better factor structure and a stronger association with disability compared with the TSK-11 (Mintken et al.\nState and trait anxiety Beside PRF, anxiety, and depression significantly mediate the relationship between pain and disability (Marshall et al.\nHowever, fear responses specifically related to a patients pain and/or potentially painful movements might be more relevant for explaining disability in chronic LBP than general trait anxiety responses (McCracken et al.\nThe current results are in line with this notion.\nFirst, most of the PRF measures did not show a significant relationship with state or trait anxiety.\nSecond, state anxiety was not decodable from fear-related brain responses to potentially harmful activities in chronic pain patients.\n1E), the harmful and the harmless conditions carried almost equal predictive neural information (52% vs 48%).\nIt might further indicate that the T-Anxiety scale captures neural responses that are associated with a more generalized fear response.\nRegarding the region weights, predictive information was predominantly provided by brain regions that were less involved in the prediction of the other PRF measures, namely parts of the mPFC and mOFC (Table 5, section E).\nThis is in line with the proposed functional differentiation of neural structures regarding fear in response to an imminent threat (defensive response) and cognitive fear/ anxiety (distal, uncertain threat) whereas the latter involves more rostral cortical structures such as the mPFC and mOFC (McNaughton and Corr, 2004; LeDoux and Pine, 2016).\nMoreover, research on self-report measurements indicates that trait anxiety is relatively distinct from tissue damage fear, which supports a behavioral and neural dissociation of trait anxiety and PRF (Cooper et al.\n, 2007; Perkins et al.\nFurthermore, the ratings did not show significant correlations with PRF measures (except the PASS-F scale; Table 2).\nOthers reported only moderate relationships (r values 0.\nThe weak relationships between ratings of perceived harmfulness and self-report measures of PRF might be explained by the specificity of the potentially harmful movements depicted by the PHODA items.\nNamely, the ratings of perceived harmfulness were specifically related to back-straining movements such as bending and lifting, while the PRF measures might also be associated with other potentially harmful movements.\nHowever, the results obtained are likely to be valid for the following several reasons: (1) the goal of the current study was not maximizing decoding performance, rather, multivariate decoding was used for the interpretation and understanding of the different PRF constructs, for which significant predictive accuracy was obtained (Hebart and Baker, 2017); (2) the applied linear SVM has been shown to exhibit good performance even in very high-dimensional settings with small sample sizes (Varoquaux and Thirion, 2014); (3) the applied regression approach using continuous variables enhances statistical power compared with a categorical analysis (e.\nFor these reasons, the differences of the prediction models are unlikely to be caused by the small sample size.\nFinally, the study design only allows interpretations of PRF to back-straining movements and LBP.\nNevertheless, the current approach might represent a promising new tool to dissect psychological constructs of self-report measures by using their neural predictors.\nConclusion This is the first time that multivariate brain response patterns have been used to better understand and dissect a psychological construct, here, PRF, conventionally assessed by selfreport (questionnaires).\nRelating content-selective neural information to potentially different psychological constructs likely supports their construct validity by revealing (hidden) commonalities or differences across psychological constructs.\ninformation served as score estimators of the FABQ (FABQ total and FABQ-W), the TSK (13and 11-item versions), and the T-Anxiety questionnaire, supporting the distinctness of the fear constructs behind these questionnaires.\nThe FABQ scales demonstrated strong predictive power with high sensitivity to the harmful condition and were associated with subcortical fear-processing regions (amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus).\nThe TSKs were more related to neural response patterns of the OFC, potentially indicating that the construct of kinesiophobia is more related to higher-order brain structures associated with anxiety, while the FABQ scales are more related to subcortical defensive responses to fear.\nFrom a clinical point of view, it might indicate that the various PRF questionnaires, although often correlating, indeed measure different fear phenotypes related to pain.\nTherefore, the results emphasize the need to carefully consider the different PRF questionnaires in research and clinical settings as their constructs do not appear to be interchangeable.\nBarke A, Preis MA, Schmidt-Samoa C, Baudewig
