{"title": "Inflammation.txt", "contents": "Chronic inflammation is associated with the increased production of cytokines and activation of pro-inflammatory pathways that ultimately can contribute to low back pain\nThis chronic inflammation may be both at the tissue and systemic level\nPathologic processes associated with facet and SI joint osteoarthritis, vertebral Modic changes, and degeneration of intervertebral discs and spinal ligaments may trigger inflammatory back pain\nObesity has been associated with metabolic, low-grade systemic inflammation\nBiomarkers can include Interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha\nIncreased cytokine production leads to modulation of other signaling molecules and increased production of downstream mediators such as substance P, prostaglandin, nitrous oxide, and matrix metalloproteinases\n\nTwo studies reported data relating TNF- (one RPF with little SOE confidence), CRP (one RPF with substantial SOE confidence), IL-6/IL-b (one RPF with substantial non-association SOE confidence) and diabetes (one RPF with substantial SOE confidence) and cLBP by self-report\nThey discuss the potential links between systemic inflammation and central sensitization\n"}
