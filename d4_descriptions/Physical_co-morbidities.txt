Physical co-morbidities include BMI, osteoarthritis, and degenerative joint disease (DJD). These contribute to oneâ€™s pain experience, biomechanics, and overall stress the body must compensate for. A direct association has been observed with obesity (BMI) and age (5th and 6th decades).

One study reported data associating lower BMI (one RPF with little SOE confidence) with improved outcomes from exercise interventions.
