Heredity may play a significant role in defining an individualâ€™s back pain risk. Genetic association has been reported for structural factors such as disc degeneration, disc herniation, disc height loss, osteophytes, lumbar stenosis, and Modic changes (31)  (32). Additionally, some evidence associates genetic variations related to expression of structural matrix proteins as well as pain perception and pain sensitivity (33) (34). Personality traits, the tendency to experience certain emotional states, and pain responding all have heritable components (35).

Two included studies discuss evidence for genetic mechanisms and describe genetic variants that increase susceptibility to sciatica (one RPF with little SOE confidence) and self-reported cLBP (one RFP with little SOE confidence).
